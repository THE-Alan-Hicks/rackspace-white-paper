<p>CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS: MapMyFitness is the leader in Connected Fitness – building the world’s largest community by providing interactive tools to make fitness social, simple and rewarding, featuring their flagship consumer brands – MapMyRun, MapMyRide, and MapMyWalk.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>MapMyFitness was searching for a trusted, managed, available hosting environment.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Performance Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/">RackConnect</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/objectrocket/">ObjectRocket</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>The MapMyFitness infrastructure on Rackspace allows scale intelligently to meet fluctuating seasonal demand and enormous year-on-year growth.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace Cloud Servers scale with popular fitness community’s rapid growth. </strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 2005, MapMyFitness is the leader in connected fitness, offering GPS-based tracking apps that have topped both Android and iOS stores’ fitness categories since their inception. The company has steadily grown and now boasts more than 22 million registered users.</p>
<p>To address seasonal demand, scale strategically, and maintain its rapid growth without compromising on performance or cost, MapMyFitness uses a variety of Rackspace services — including dedicated and cloud servers, RackConnect, and MongoDB management services from ObjectRocket.</p>
<p><strong>Coming To Rackspace</strong></p>
<p>“Our first Rackspace server was in 2007,” says Jesse Demmel, Vice President, Engineering at MapMyFitness. “We were looking for a trusted environment and availability was also concern. We did a lot of comparisons with other solutions and landed on Rackspace as the best alternative to support the growth that was anticipated for MapMyFitness in the future.”</p>
<p>“What initially drew us to Rackspace were cost and reliability,” Demmel says, “as well as the ability to get the benefits and performance of a dedicated environment without any of the hassle of managing it. When you’re a very small startup, that’s a super attractive thing.”</p>
<p>“Managing the dedicated footprint has been really valuable, because those are pieces we don’t have to worry about in house,” Demmel explains, “As we’ve grown, one thing that has kept us at Rackspace is the cloud, and the RackConnect to the dedicated side, which gets us really low latency from cloud to dedicated.”</p>
<p><strong>Building The Right Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Total MapMyFitness’ customer base has at least doubled every year since it began. In addition to this consistent growth, data volume fluctuates in a predictable pattern each year.</p>
<p>Demmel explains, “Every year we are growing at a rate of 2.5x in terms of the data that we have to support. Our traffic is very cyclical: summer is our peak, and it starts trickling down during the fall until it gets to holidays and picks back up with New Year’s resolutions. We’re at least doubling page views and mobile sessions year over year on top of increased user engagement.”</p>
<p>To address the steady growth and fluctuation, DevOps has been a crucial component of MapMyFitness’ strategy. “We make heavy use of Puppet to fully automate our environment, and we practice continuous deployment, deploying to production daily for the web and as often as we can for mobile,” Demmel says. “We integrate tightly with development, embedding DevOps personnel with our development team as they’re building features to ensure that we can handle the performance and that we’re building out the infrastructure appropriately at the right time.”</p>
<p><strong>Performance Cloud Assists With Automation</strong></p>
<p>Demmel sees the addition of Performance Cloud servers as an exciting step that will further enable the company’s journey toward total automation.</p>
<p>“We’re getting 5x better performance out of the Performance Cloud than the previous generation of the cloud,” Demmel says. “We’re really excited about Performance Cloud, and we think we can finally get there in terms of our automation desires, so that eventually we won’t have to touch anything and the system can automatically scale up and down as needed without us having to do much.”</p>
<p>“As we’ve grown, Rackspace solutions and offerings have grown with us,” says Demmel. “That’s nice, because we can scale into the cloud for peak times and go back to baseline dedicated hardware when we aren’t bursting.”</p>
<p><strong>ObjectRocket Solution For Database</strong></p>
<p>Despite the company’s success with Performance Cloud, they still find dedicated to be the best solution for their database needs. “We’ve wanted to keep the databases on dedicated hardware due to the need for high IOPS,” Demmel explains. “In recent years, it’s been shown that high IOPS for databases is possible in the cloud as well, but the cost and reliability of dedicated hardware is still much better than the cloud.”</p>
<p>While MapMyFitness’ MySQL databases average more than 9,000 queries per second (spiking at twice that volume), the company looks to Mongo DB as a solution that will allow it to grow cost effectively.</p>
<p>“What led us to Mongo was that classic relational databases scale vertically, and aren’t cheap to do right,” Demmel says. “It was a cost choice. You look at the company and how fast it’s going to grow and where we’re going to be in five years, ten years, and a vertically scalable solution like MySQL was pretty cost-prohibitive.”</p>
<p>The company first experimented with Cassandra, but Demmel says, “When we tried Mongo, it was just much simpler to get up and running, and much easier to get high performance out of it. It’s a pretty simple database on the surface to get going, and when you want to fine tune it, it’s got the ability to really get the performance you need. It’s been very reliable for us.”</p>
<p>When Rackspace acquired MongoDB-as-a-service company ObjectRocket, Demmel says the company was initially skeptical, believing they’d built a substantial amount of Mongo expertise in-house. They decided to give it a try anyway. “The performance numbers spoke for themselves,” Demmel says. “Not only was the performance fantastic, but what it would cost us to do the same with dedicated hardware and maintenance made using the ObjectRocket solution a no-brainer.”</p>
<p>“Although it can be risky putting your data in the hands of a third party, Demmel says, ObjectRocket has been excellent at providing MapMyFitness visibility. “They’re good at training and helping us understand exactly how the environment’s running, so that we could do it on our own if we need to later.”</p>
<p><strong>Looking Toward The Future</strong></p>
<p>MapMyFitness was recently acquired by Under Armour. “It’s a fantastic partnership. Under Armour will be able to leverage our Connected Fitness platform to drive innovation in performance apparel, wearable technology and much more,” Demmel says. “As we dove into the integration process, it’s very clear that our cultures are closely aligned. It’s just an absolutely wonderful fit, and we’re really excited about the opportunity.”</p>
<p>With the acquisition, MapMyFitness is poised for even more explosive growth, and Rackspace and ObjectRocket will be there to support them along the way.</p>
