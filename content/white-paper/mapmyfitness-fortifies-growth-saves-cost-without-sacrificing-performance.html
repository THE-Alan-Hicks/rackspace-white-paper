<p>CUSTOMER&rsquo;S BUSINESS: MapMyFitness is the leader in Connected Fitness &ndash; building the world&rsquo;s largest community by providing interactive tools to make fitness social, simple and rewarding, featuring their flagship consumer brands &ndash; MapMyRun, MapMyRide, and MapMyWalk.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>MapMyFitness was searching for a trusted, managed, available hosting environment.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Performance Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/">RackConnect</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/objectrocket/">ObjectRocket</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>The MapMyFitness infrastructure on Rackspace allows scale intelligently to meet fluctuating seasonal demand and enormous year-on-year growth.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace Cloud Servers scale with popular fitness community&rsquo;s rapid growth. </strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 2005, MapMyFitness is the leader in connected fitness, offering GPS-based tracking apps that have topped both Android and iOS stores&rsquo; fitness categories since their inception. The company has steadily grown and now boasts more than 22 million registered users.</p>
<p>To address seasonal demand, scale strategically, and maintain its rapid growth without compromising on performance or cost, MapMyFitness uses a variety of Rackspace services &mdash; including dedicated and cloud servers, RackConnect, and MongoDB management services from ObjectRocket.</p>
<p><strong>Coming To Rackspace</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first Rackspace server was in 2007,&rdquo; says Jesse Demmel, Vice President, Engineering at MapMyFitness. &ldquo;We were looking for a trusted environment and availability was also concern. We did a lot of comparisons with other solutions and landed on Rackspace as the best alternative to support the growth that was anticipated for MapMyFitness in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What initially drew us to Rackspace were cost and reliability,&rdquo; Demmel says, &ldquo;as well as the ability to get the benefits and performance of a dedicated environment without any of the hassle of managing it. When you&rsquo;re a very small startup, that&rsquo;s a super attractive thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Managing the dedicated footprint has been really valuable, because those are pieces we don&rsquo;t have to worry about in house,&rdquo; Demmel explains, &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve grown, one thing that has kept us at Rackspace is the cloud, and the RackConnect to the dedicated side, which gets us really low latency from cloud to dedicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Building The Right Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Total MapMyFitness&rsquo; customer base has at least doubled every year since it began. In addition to this consistent growth, data volume fluctuates in a predictable pattern each year.</p>
<p>Demmel explains, &ldquo;Every year we are growing at a rate of 2.5x in terms of the data that we have to support. Our traffic is very cyclical: summer is our peak, and it starts trickling down during the fall until it gets to holidays and picks back up with New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. We&rsquo;re at least doubling page views and mobile sessions year over year on top of increased user engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To address the steady growth and fluctuation, DevOps has been a crucial component of MapMyFitness&rsquo; strategy. &ldquo;We make heavy use of Puppet to fully automate our environment, and we practice continuous deployment, deploying to production daily for the web and as often as we can for mobile,&rdquo; Demmel says. &ldquo;We integrate tightly with development, embedding DevOps personnel with our development team as they&rsquo;re building features to ensure that we can handle the performance and that we&rsquo;re building out the infrastructure appropriately at the right time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Performance Cloud Assists With Automation</strong></p>
<p>Demmel sees the addition of Performance Cloud servers as an exciting step that will further enable the company&rsquo;s journey toward total automation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting 5x better performance out of the Performance Cloud than the previous generation of the cloud,&rdquo; Demmel says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really excited about Performance Cloud, and we think we can finally get there in terms of our automation desires, so that eventually we won&rsquo;t have to touch anything and the system can automatically scale up and down as needed without us having to do much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve grown, Rackspace solutions and offerings have grown with us,&rdquo; says Demmel. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, because we can scale into the cloud for peak times and go back to baseline dedicated hardware when we aren&rsquo;t bursting.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>ObjectRocket Solution For Database</strong></p>
<p>Despite the company&rsquo;s success with Performance Cloud, they still find dedicated to be the best solution for their database needs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wanted to keep the databases on dedicated hardware due to the need for high IOPS,&rdquo; Demmel explains. &ldquo;In recent years, it&rsquo;s been shown that high IOPS for databases is possible in the cloud as well, but the cost and reliability of dedicated hardware is still much better than the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While MapMyFitness&rsquo; MySQL databases average more than 9,000 queries per second (spiking at twice that volume), the company looks to Mongo DB as a solution that will allow it to grow cost effectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What led us to Mongo was that classic relational databases scale vertically, and aren&rsquo;t cheap to do right,&rdquo; Demmel says. &ldquo;It was a cost choice. You look at the company and how fast it&rsquo;s going to grow and where we&rsquo;re going to be in five years, ten years, and a vertically scalable solution like MySQL was pretty cost-prohibitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company first experimented with Cassandra, but Demmel says, &ldquo;When we tried Mongo, it was just much simpler to get up and running, and much easier to get high performance out of it. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple database on the surface to get going, and when you want to fine tune it, it&rsquo;s got the ability to really get the performance you need. It&rsquo;s been very reliable for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rackspace acquired MongoDB-as-a-service company ObjectRocket, Demmel says the company was initially skeptical, believing they&rsquo;d built a substantial amount of Mongo expertise in-house. They decided to give it a try anyway. &ldquo;The performance numbers spoke for themselves,&rdquo; Demmel says. &ldquo;Not only was the performance fantastic, but what it would cost us to do the same with dedicated hardware and maintenance made using the ObjectRocket solution a no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although it can be risky putting your data in the hands of a third party, Demmel says, ObjectRocket has been excellent at providing MapMyFitness visibility. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re good at training and helping us understand exactly how the environment&rsquo;s running, so that we could do it on our own if we need to later.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Toward The Future</strong></p>
<p>MapMyFitness was recently acquired by Under Armour. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fantastic partnership. Under Armour will be able to leverage our Connected Fitness platform to drive innovation in performance apparel, wearable technology and much more,&rdquo; Demmel says. &ldquo;As we dove into the integration process, it&rsquo;s very clear that our cultures are closely aligned. It&rsquo;s just an absolutely wonderful fit, and we&rsquo;re really excited about the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the acquisition, MapMyFitness is poised for even more explosive growth, and Rackspace and ObjectRocket will be there to support them along the way.</p>
