<p><strong>CUSTOMER&rsquo;S BUSINESS:</strong> Engagency helps customers optimize digital user experiences in Sitecore.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> Searching for a hosting provider that could lower costs and deliver faster, more accurate diagnostic solutions, with shorter cycles and fewer delays.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE</strong><strong>&reg; </strong><strong>SOLUTION</strong><strong>: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Cloud Servers with a Managed Service Level</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/?cm_mmc=PPCCA-_-Google-_-broad-_-online+storage+cloud">Cloud Files</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/">Cloud Load Balancers</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME</strong><strong>:</strong> Rackspace has given Engagency higher levels of expertise and responsiveness which have allowed the firm to deliver consistently stronger diagnostic support and better peace of mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace specialists help match the Sitecore license to hardware.</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 2002, Engagency is a Web Experience Management systems integrator, and a Sitecore Certified Solutions Partner. Engagency helps customers in a variety of industries, including financial, consumer, retail, education and non-profit, to improve operations by optimizing and personalizing the thousands of individual digital experiences taking place on virtually any platform or device. As Sitecore experts, Engagency provides Sitecore consulting, implementation, personalized user training and dedicated ongoing support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have worked with Rackspace for years because of the quality of service,&rdquo; explains Jason Perry, Engagency President and CEO. &ldquo;Life at Engagency without Rackspace would be a lot of sleepless nights. Rackspace has our back; they&rsquo;re just as committed to taking care of our customers as we are. With Rackspace, I know there is always someone physically there at the data center monitoring whether something&rsquo;s up or down and ready to mobilize our support teams when something does go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Activating the Rackspace Solution</strong></p>
<p>Engagency works with each customer to determine needs in terms of uptime and availability. Next, a dedicated team of Rackspace specialists helps match the Sitecore license to hardware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rackspace Digital is easy to work with because they really get Sitecore,&rdquo; Perry says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about identifying the issue and then taking a proactive approach. We are more confident that with Rackspace, we&rsquo;re providing a hosting and service offering which leaves the customer feeling happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company also benefits from having much more affordable access to the latest enterprise technology and expertise that only larger companies could previously afford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rackspace helps our team of Sitecore experts amplify the level and quality of the services we provide,&rdquo; Perry says. &ldquo;Now we can not only deliver fast response, but also consistent diagnostic expertise. This gives our customers peace of mind, an enhanced support experience, and also ensures round-the-clock reliability.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency Lets Engagency Focus on What&rsquo;s Next</strong></p>
<p>Rackspace ensures a combination of technological tools and high- level service which Engagency would not find elsewhere. With Rackspace Cloud, Engagency is seeing agility increase and its hardware and legacy investments recede. As a result, people can focus their energies on the primary work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fanatical Support is kind of an understatement,&rdquo; Perry says. &ldquo;Rackspace has perfected the art of going above and beyond. We recently had a customer that had a DDoS attack while we were rolling out a site. Rackspace helped us diagnose the problem and then had an immediate debriefing after the site went live. It led to our starting a whole new service with DDoS monitoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Engagency plans to move into hybrid solutions as well, according to Perry. &ldquo;We tend toward hosting on physical hardware, but have also been experimenting. We&rsquo;re eager to see the implementation of more hybrid solutions in the enterprise space for the future.&rdquo;</p>
