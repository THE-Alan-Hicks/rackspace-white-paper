<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> Partnering with Rackspace has allowed the Zeara footprint to grow on a linear scale, and customers are now experiencing 100% uptime.</p>
<h3><strong>With Rackspace infrastructure, services and support, clients are now experience 100% uptime. </strong></h3>
<p>Zeara is one of Australia&rsquo;s leading cloud solution providers with more than five years&rsquo; experience developing, managing, and supporting market leading cloud products and services. The company partners with companies who recognise the importance of having a cloud strategy in place to drive further business growth and increase profits. Zeara currently offers tailored cloud solutions built on our cloud platform that include hosted desktop, hosted applications and cloud servers.</p>
<p>As one of Australia&rsquo;s leading cloud solution providers, Zeara had partnered with several local hosting providers, ending in the same result of poor service and support. Zeara&rsquo;s General Manager, Daniel Keleher is the person responsible for overall business management, finances, operations and team development, as well as being the lead in securing a trusted hosting provider for the company. Keleher says, &ldquo;Previous hosting providers didn&rsquo;t provide any support with which we could trust. Outages and maintenance were performed without any notification. They were making us look bad to our clients, while we were continually doing everything possible to deliver on the experience and then being badly let down by our infrastructure provider. It was extremely frustrating.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Rackspace Footprint in Australia</strong></p>
<p>With the goal of finding a trusted hosting provider that could deliver the proper infrastructure for Zeara, coupled with service and support, Keleher continued testing local providers. Managing hardware and platform, with core routing and Australia based 24/7/365 support were the core competencies that Zeara was unable to find within the locally based hosting provider network.</p>
<p>Building a partnership with a trusted hosting provider was paramount for Zeara. As Rackspace announced that the Australian continent was opening as part of its global expansion, excitement grew inside the development team at Zeara. Keleher explains, &ldquo;We had basically tested every hosting provider in Australia. As soon as we heard Rackspace were coming to Australia, we were one of the first to jump onboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Migrating to a Trusted Hosting Partner</strong></p>
<p>With the Rackspace footprint established in Australia, data centres online and local support up and running, Zeara made the commitment to partner with and migrate its infrastructure to its new trusted global hosting partner. &ldquo;Everything regarding the migration of Zeara to Rackspace was made very clear to us from the beginning,&rdquo; Keleher says. &ldquo;We had to provide certain information about the setup and design by a deadline. We knew if we missed the deadline it would delay the roll out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we had a number of questions along the way and they were addressed over email or a phone meeting to ensure everyone was on the same page,&rdquo; says Keleher. With the migration strategy collaboration between the two companies deployed, it was obvious to Zeara that the support level they had been searching for was achieved. &ldquo;Fanatical support &ndash; It&rsquo;s not just a motto,&rdquo; continues Keleher. &ldquo;Rackspace delivered on it time and time again throughout the migration process and beyond. It&rsquo;s crucial for us. Our business is now built on Rackspace, it&rsquo;s that simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Growing Business on a Linear Scale</strong></p>
<p>Fully deployed on Rackspace for nearly two years now, Zeara is prepared for growth. &ldquo;Using Rackspace has allowed our footprint to grow on a linear scale,&rdquo; Keleher says. &ldquo;This is very important to us and keeps us one step ahead of our competitors without compromising on security and performance of our cloud platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With performance, security and support dialed in, customers have nothing to worry about when deploying Zeara&rsquo;s market leading cloud products and services. Keleher is pleased to announce that, &ldquo;since the migration to Rackspace, we have experienced 100 % uptime and only twice for a period of less than five minutes was the performance degraded due to denial of service attacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the future looks bright for Zeara with Rackspace as a trusted global hosting provider. &ldquo;We plan to continue building on the successful relationship with Rackspace moving forward,&rdquo; concludes Keleher. &ldquo;We are looking at incorporating other Rackspace products and services to continue providing our clients with cost effective and flexible cloud solutions.&rdquo;</p>
