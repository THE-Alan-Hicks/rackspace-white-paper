Bob Noll, Manager of Information Technology, says, &ldquo;I live and die by email as a tech.&rdquo; Software release notifications, vendor correspondence, quotes, renewals, and general business correspondence are all handled by email. When he realized that their outbound messages weren&rsquo;t being delivered and they weren&rsquo;t getting any delivery failure notifications, they went to their email provider for resolution.</p><p>However, when Bob contacted their email hosting provider, there was no help desk available. By going to their website, he found out the provider no longer supported his email product. They never even notified him of the change in support, and now the pediatric clinic was stuck with no one to call for help. &ldquo;It was simply unacceptable,&rdquo; says Bob. Northwest Pediatrics needed secure, reliable email right away with a responsive, dependable provider.</p><h3>Rackspace Email is the Clear Winner</h3><p>The process of finding a new provider was easy once he landed on the Rackspace website. &ldquo;I was impressed with the site and how much thought was put into it,&rdquo; recognizes Bob. &ldquo;The website is well-organized, easy to understand, and I liked the no &lsquo;car salesman approach.&rsquo; Many websites are so unclear that you end up having to call a salesperson who, in the end, doesn&rsquo;t have the answer for you.&rdquo;</p><p>After reviewing our business email services online, he selected Rackspace Email for the office. Rackspace Email provides them with affordable enterprise-level business email service, plus an application suite including calendar, contacts, tasks, and notes. They also get mobile sync service and unlimited access to Fanatical Support.</p><p>He was even more impressed when he called and got someone on the phone immediately. &ldquo;I was happy with how smooth and easy it was to do business with you. Everyone and everything was very transparent. I am thoroughly impressed with Fanatical Support,&rdquo; says Bob. He found the support site documentation especially helpful. &ldquo;I knew exactly how to get our email up and running after reading the information on your support site.&rdquo;</p><p>Northwest Pediatric Associates had the best kind of transition to Rackspace, &ldquo;End-users didn&rsquo;t even realize when the switch had occurred. Everything just worked and there were no delays,&rdquo; reports Bob.</p><h3>Another Happy Rackspace Email Customer</h3><p>&ldquo;With Rackspace Email, we can access email anywhere, whether in a hotel room or overseas. That&rsquo;s something we didn&rsquo;t have with our previous provider,&rdquo; according to Bob. After the problems he experienced with his previous providers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed with deliverability.&rdquo; He reports that our spam filters are &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; allowing him to get only the email he wants. And, best of all, according to Bob, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s secure. I know my email is being read by who should be reading it and being sent by who should be sending it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On-shore support, where everyone speaks English, is a big plus to us. Many companies have outsourced support overseas, and the language barrier alters a fanatical experience,&rdquo; Bob explains. He prefers using chat for quick answers to easy issues. For more in-depth issues, he can access live representatives by phone around the clock. Each time he calls, &ldquo;You can feel the exuberance to serve the customer. It&rsquo;s great to see such a customer-focused company. You can tell, all you want is a happy customer,&rdquo; he says. And, it looks like we have another happy customer in Northwest Pediatric Associates.</p>
