<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME</strong>: Deliver a consistently reliable, always on, responsive customer experience for DDP Yoga customers, allowing DDP Yoga to lower costs and focus on their application to increase revenue.</p>

<h3><strong>Scaling faster growth, and healthier lives, in the Rackspace Managed Cloud.</strong></h3>

<p>Founded in 1998 by former three times WCW World Heavyweight Champion Diamond Dallas Page, DDP Yoga provides a convenient, holistic fitness and lifestyle program and online community centered on the benefits of yoga. The company markets a unique fitness system combining yoga with other exercise and wellness practices. In a normally female-dominated activity, DPP Yoga has also found success attracting male customers.</p>

<p>As DDP Yoga has grown, its technical staff experienced higher volumes of data and traffic load. The company also experienced seasonal traffic spikes associated with fitness, such as post-holiday activity increases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we started, we went from a shared server environment to dedicated with that hosting provider,&rdquo; explains Steve Yu, DDP Yoga President. &ldquo;When we began growing, the provider started having outages. With increasing demand and a limited budget, downtime for us of even a few hours could mean thousands of dollars lost. We resolved to find a more reliable hosting company.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Environment to Scale Quickly</strong></p>

<p>DDP Yoga needed be able to scale its environment quickly. &ldquo;We were curious about load balancing, but didn&rsquo;t know how much bandwidth or backend power we&rsquo;d need&rdquo; said Yu. &ldquo;This immediate flexibility was one of the key reasons why we went with Rackspace Managed Cloud, in case we had to scale for a big event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That &lsquo;big event&rsquo; arrived in the form of DDP Yoga&rsquo;s recent participation in a nationwide broadcast TV series, Shark Tank. With intense traffic spikes anticipated during and after the show&rsquo;s air schedule, DDP Yoga relied on database traffic management solution ScaleArc, recommended by Rackspace, to manage voluminous database traffic and accelerate heavy queries resulting from the nationwide TV exposure.</p>

<p>After several weeks of preparation, DDP Yoga had a cohesive Rackspace Managed Cloud environment consisting of 25x8GB web servers and 2x30GB database servers, along with the ScaleArc database traffic management solution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During all four airings of DDP&rsquo;s Shark Tank episode, a conference bridge was set up for the entire team in the event of an issue,&rdquo; explains Magda Esparza, Rackspace Cloud Advisor. &ldquo;Due to an unforeseen bottleneck in their environment, the DDP Yoga site did experience a small amount of downtime during one of the events. Our planned approach and swift troubleshooting helped ensure success for DDP Yoga&rsquo;s involvement in the program, which produced record-breaking sales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having the ScaleArc team in place turned out to be great as we moved into the Shark Tank rollout,&rdquo; said Yu. &ldquo;Of course, at the start I wondered how it was going to work bringing on this other partner. Would it work with the whole team? Am I going to now have to manage this other team and what they&rsquo;re doing? What ended up happening was that Rackspace managed the whole team. It didn&rsquo;t feel like we were working with two different companies. It was seamless.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Rackspace Managed Cloud Delivers</strong></p>

<p>Using a Rackspace architecture consisting of five database servers connected to multiple cloud web servers, DDP Yoga is taking advantage of the Rackspace Managed Cloud to deliver consistently, globally and with quick response times, to a customer base that&rsquo;s growing at a rapid clip. And, Rackspace is helping DDP Yoga deliver maximum availability of all its online offerings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In load testing for Shark Tank, we did see quite a significant performance increase,&rdquo; said Yu. &ldquo;But the number one reason why we want to work with Rackspace is Fanatical Support&reg;. Rackspace takes ownership of the success of our company. This high level of customer service solves a lot of business issues for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have a lot of confidence in Rackspace&rsquo;s technical team to have the knowledge and the troubleshooting ability,&rdquo; said Yu. &ldquo;Now that we have Managed Cloud, I can look at a support ticket and just know what&rsquo;s going on as opposed to okay, I have to fix it. I can focus on strategy and not worry so much about whether or not the site is up and running.&rdquo;</p>
