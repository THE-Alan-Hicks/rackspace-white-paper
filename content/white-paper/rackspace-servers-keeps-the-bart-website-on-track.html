By offering on-time, reasonably-priced rail service, BART&rsquo;s originators hoped to address potential traffic congestion and other issues that could have a negative impact on San Francisco&rsquo;s community and quality of life.<br /><br />That vision resonates even more strongly today. BART is one of the most-used municipal rail systems in the United States. Every day, it gives an average of 327,629 passengers a way to minimize their carbon footprints by using public transportation.<br /><br />Needless to say, meeting those riders&rsquo; needs requires BART to dedicate extensive resources to its core business: running trains. But as a municipal transportation services provider, BART must also maintain a customer-facing IT infrastructure to communicate information about its business and rail services. Just as the public depends on BART&rsquo;s trains, it also depends on BART&rsquo;s website to be up-to-date and available around the clock&mdash;which is why BART hosts its web applications on Rackspace servers.</p><h3>PEOPLE ON HAND, AROUND THE CLOCK, TO KEEP SERVERS ONLINE</h3><p>BART&rsquo;s web services have always been hosted by an outside provider, explains Timothy Moore, Website Manager, BART. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not part of IT. We&rsquo;re a two-person shop within corporate communications,&rdquo; Moore says. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the resources to manage server hardware ourselves.&rdquo;<br /><br />It took some time, however, to find a managed hosting provider that really meets BART&rsquo;s needs.<br /><br />&ldquo;Our last provider was acquired several times during the course of our relationship,&rdquo; Moore notes. The transitions associated with the acquisitions were disruptive, which was worrisome enough. Then one day, the site began experiencing connectivity issues. &ldquo;One of our PR initiatives resulted in an uptick in traffic,&rdquo; Moore says, &ldquo;and people were having trouble viewing the site.&rdquo; But when Moore called the provider&rsquo;s help desk, the support staff didn&rsquo;t convey any sense of urgency. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t seem to be very motivated to help us. I realized they just didn&rsquo;t understand our needs.&rdquo;<br /><br />The incident also served to highlight the need for a more robust web server infrastructure. &ldquo;We live in earthquake country,&rdquo; Moore notes. &ldquo;We realized we needed to be better prepared to communicate with the public and the media in the event of a natural disaster.&rdquo;<br /><br />So BART issued a Request for Proposal for a new hosting provider for its web servers, and Rackspace won the business. &ldquo;Rackspace was able to locate servers outside of our area,&rdquo; Moore notes, which was important from a disaster recovery standpoint. But equally important was Rackspace&rsquo;s commitment to delivering top-notch support. &ldquo;With Rackspace, we know we have people on hand, around the clock, to help us keep our servers online,&rdquo; Moore says.</p><h3>PROACTIVE SUPPORT TEAM THAT TAKES OWNERSHIP OF ISSUES</h3><p>The migration to Rackspace from BART&rsquo;s former hosting provider was seamless. &ldquo;It was clear from the beginning that this was a play Rackspace had run numerous times,&rdquo; Moore says. &ldquo;It was very orderly, with no downtime.&rdquo;<br /><br />Since the transition, the uptime of BART&rsquo;s web servers has been excellent. &ldquo;The configuration problems and other little things that used to pop up have completely gone away,&rdquo; Moore says.<br /><br />Any time there has been an issue or question, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Rackspace Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup></a> has lived up to its reputation. &ldquo;With Rackspace support, someone always takes ownership,&rdquo; Moore says. &ldquo;And they are very proactive about informing us about what is going on.&rdquo;<br /><br />With Rackspace, BART also knows it can quickly scale up its website capacity. &ldquo;Rackspace can add more bandwidth on the networking side, and also provision new servers if we need them,&rdquo; Moore notes.<br /><br />The improved availability of BART&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/">web servers</a>, along with the ability to add capacity if needed, better equips the transit service to meet its customer needs. Equally important, it helps the transit service maintain its commitment to openness and innovation. BART uses its web servers, for instance, to publish rail service data and Application Program Interfaces (APIs). Some 1500 developers use this BART service to develop third party applications for San Francisco residents. The apps do everything from serve up-to-the-minute train arrival data to peoples&rsquo; mobile phones, to helping prospective home buyers determine which neighborhoods are situated near BART stations.<br /><br />&ldquo;We were looking for a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">hosting provider</a> that would be stable for the long haul,&rdquo; Moore says. &ldquo;And we needed a high level of support and services. We found exactly what we needed for our mission critical systems when we found Rackspace.&rdquo;</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
