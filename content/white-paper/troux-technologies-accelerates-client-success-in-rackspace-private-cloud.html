<p><strong>CUSTOMER&rsquo;S BUSINESS:</strong> Troux Technologies provides software and services that help companies align IT with business goals.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> Needing a hosting partner that can provide high availability and performance with strict security standards.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE&reg; SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/">Rackspace Private Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/">RackConnect&reg;</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> Consistent, secure and scalable performance; the ability to reallocate resources and innovate.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace offers platform architecture that delivers business results.</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in Austin, Texas, in 2001, Troux Technologies performs enterprise portfolio management and enterprise architecture for Global 2000 customers including leading global financial institutions, multinationals in various industries and governmental clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are customers that have big IT spends, big complicated problems, and they really need help understanding: are they spending their money in the right places?&rdquo; explains Craig Dalton, Senior VP of Customer Success at Troux Technologies. &ldquo;Troux was created to help make sure that their IT spend and business goals are speaking the same language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Troux Enterprise Portfolio Management (EPM) solution, Troux On-Demand, provides enterprise architecture and enterprise portfolio management capabilities in a user-friendly platform. Customers using Troux tools may also undertake agile portfolio management and enterprise architecture, based on OpenStack and the Rackspace Private Cloud, and powered globally throughout datacenters in the United States, London, Hong Kong and Australia. In addition, Troux helps with configuration management databases, project portfolio management systems and asset management systems.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Trust and Enabling Growth</strong></p>
<p>When large enterprise and governmental customers came to Troux concerned about security, uptime, reliability and quality, the company found Rackspace to be the best fit for its rapidly developing needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have customers who have saved millions based on the decisions that they&rsquo;ve made in Troux On-Demand,&rdquo; said Dalton. &ldquo;They want business results quickly and we&rsquo;ve found that Rackspace offers the specific architectures that address those needs. Rackspace has enabled us the agility that we needed to get systems on-boarded, to get our customers in, and ultimately to create Troux On-Demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company first introduced Troux On-Demand on top of the public cloud. As the product has grown, Troux has moved infrastructure to the private cloud to take full advantage of OpenStack scalability, security, privacy and control backed by Rackspace expertise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To improve performance and our security for our backend, we were faced with options we didn&rsquo;t have with our cloud solutions at the time,&rdquo; said Mark Castoe, Troux&rsquo;s Chief Architect for Services. &ldquo;In communication with our team at Rackspace, we became aware of security, performance, and cost benefits of moving to private cloud. We moved our U.S. cloud to private cloud, and we&rsquo;re now moving our UK operations to private cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Castoe goes on to say, &ldquo;The architecture from Rackspace that we use is a combination of the public cloud, the private cloud and dedicated hosting. We have it all connected globally using RackConnect. So we&rsquo;re managing a global enterprise for our Troux on-demand customers and our managed hosting customers from one central place here in Austin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Strong SaaS Offerings = Reliable Customer Experience</strong></p>
<p>Because of Rackspace, Troux has doubled the infrastructure committed to Troux On-Demand, at a lower cost, and has added features such as single sign-on authentication, as well as global distributed systems using the security that the RackConnect provides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troux On-Demand is built on top of the Rackspace Private Cloud, which has enabled us to innovate and help our customers meet their business needs, and gives them the confidence to put their enterprise portfolio management data into our hands,&rdquo; says Dalton.</p>
<p>As Troux&rsquo;s global client base accelerates, the company can foresee more work involving <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/datacenters/">Rackspace&rsquo;s global network</a>. Troux intends to rely even more on cloud automation and scalability, can take advantage of other Rackspace offerings such as offsite backups. And since customers are dealing with ever-increasing amounts of data, the Rackspace Private Cloud will enable Troux to continue to tailor services scaled for specific customer trends.</p>
<p>&rdquo;Because of the quality of the platform and the technically sound, industry-leading technologies such as Rackspace Private Cloud based on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/">OpenStack</a>, we are able to offer services like Troux-On-Demand to our customers&rdquo; concludes Dalton. &ldquo;But the most important differentiator is leadership from the people at Rackspace. Call it <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/whyrackspace/">Fanatical Support&reg;</a> or just smart people who are really looking out for our interest.&rdquo;</p>
