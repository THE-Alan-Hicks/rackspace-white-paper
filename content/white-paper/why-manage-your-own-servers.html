<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">It’s a tough time for most CIOs, suffering the worst budget crunch of their careers. In a recent survey by CIO magazine, two out of three CIOs admitted the recession meant more scrutiny of their budgets. Gartner reports 88% of all enterprises reduced IT budgets during 20092 ... and more than half froze IT budgets or made additional cuts in 2010.&nbsp;<strong>This white paper is intended to help CIOs under budget pressure, by:</strong></p><ul style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><li>Defining the new era of “IT 2.0” and what it means for CIOs</li><li>Describing a time-tested way to focus on key strategic activities</li><li>Suggesting one item you could easily outsource: managing your own servers.</li></ul><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>WHAT IS IT 2.0?</strong></p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">As you know, Web 2.0 is quickly transforming business-as-usual into something new. A younger generation who grew up with the web expects to use blogs, Facebook®, forums, LinkedIn®, Twitter®, wikis and every other cool new web-based service at work. As the leading edge of the Baby Boom starts hitting 65 in 2010, no one can deny it any longer: a younger generation is taking over. And that younger generation includes both your employees and your customers. IT has to adapt, or become irrelevant. In the era of IT 2.0, your users and customers don’t want excuses; they want instant access to anything, anytime, anywhere. And if you don’t give it to them, someone else will: Your users will sign up for SaaS or free web services, and your prospects will click away to another site. That means IT managers must evolve from geeky engineers into service-oriented business analysts. “The IT leaders of tomorrow,” blogged Sarah Perez in a seminal posting, ”the ones working with the CEOs to execute the vision and direction via IT, will no longer be... the classic computer geek. To become an IT leader of tomorrow means more than tolerating Facebook and Twitter. It means becoming a lot savvier about where to focus your efforts and your budget to help boost your company’s bottom line.</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>CORE VS. CONTEXT: MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE</strong></p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">The ultimate factor driving IT change “will be the long-developing trend toward companies hiring only the professionals who serve the core competencies of their business, and outsourcing everything else.” says the editor-in-chief of TechRepublic. This is not news. This trend was described a decade ago by technology guru Geoffrey Moore in his book “Living on the Fault Line.” He made a key distinction between core and context; in his view, core is anything that gives your firm an essential competitive edge. Everything else is context. “For core activities, the goal is to differentiate as much as possible on any variable that impacts customers’ purchase decisions, and to assign one’s best resources to that challenge,” he wrote. Core is the key to success. “Every other activity in the corporation—and this is typically the overwhelming bulk of all activities—is not core. It is context,” notes Moore. “And the winning approach to context tasks is not to differentiate, but to execute them effectively and efficiently in as standardized a manner as possible.” That’s why SaaS is so successful in areas like email, payroll, sales force automation, and HR. These are all routine chores, so there is no loss of competitive advantage if you do them the same way everyone else does.</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>THE IT DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE CORE</strong></p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">The point is: IT needs to stop wasting money on things that don’t matter, and focus on the few areas that make customers buy. IT needs to focus on the core, as shown in Figure 1. The best investment of the IT department’s time, energy and money is in the green zone: in a few selected projects, activities, and line items that make a real contribution to your company’s success. Everything else can be outsourced, and it won’t make a big difference. The truth is, no one cares that you replaced a server over the weekend. That kind of routine maintenance doesn’t give your company an edge. Sorry, that’s just part of the scenery that everyone else takes for granted, like cleaning the office. That’s bad news if you’re still managing servers, or renting space in a data center around the corner, with your team wearing pagers to take those emergency calls in the middle of the night. Where would your management team place those expenses? In the green zone, as a wise investment that adds to the business success? Or in the red, as a good prospect for a budget cut?</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>CUT AND GROW AT THE SAME TIME?</strong></p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">Gartner notes that CIOs are now being pulled in two directions at once: “The business needs cost savings to protect financial results—yet it also needs new solutions to retain current and attract new customers.”</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>But how is it possible to cut and grow at the same time?</strong>&nbsp;The surest way is to go through your budget and outsource as many routine activities (context) as you can. Then focus like a laser on the core activities that truly make a difference:</p><ul style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><li>New products and services</li><li>A more effective web presence</li><li>Speeding up transaction-processing</li><li>Anything else that gives your enterprise a competitive advantage</li></ul><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">Otherwise, someone else may do this for you. For example, your management team probably doesn’t count maintaining your own servers as mission-critical. So why keep on doing it?</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><strong>LOOKING GOOD ON YOUR BUDGET</strong></p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">These days, you can move your servers to an innovative form of outsourcing called managed colocation that will cut several line items from your budget. In true managed colocation, the service provider takes care of all the hardware, networking, and other devices you need in the data center. You lease this equipment, you don’t buy it. At the same time, you maintain control of your software environment, including your OS and your apps. Since you can manage your software remotely, you no longer need to be close to your data center. That opens up a wider pool of service providers to choose from, and enables you to select one based on more important factors than its location. All this will look good on your budget, and help you focus IT efforts where you make the biggest difference. That will buy you more respect from the bean-counters, from your people and from your customers.
