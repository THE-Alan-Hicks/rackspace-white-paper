<h2>What is NUMA?</h2>

<p>NUMA stands for Non-Uniform Memory Access. In a NUMA architecture, each CPU is assigned its own local memory, and the CPU and memory combined form a NUMA node.</p>

<p><strong>Local MEM + CPU CORES = NUMA Node</strong></p>

<p>NUMA is important because it enables a processor to access its own local memory faster than non-local memory, such as memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors. However, if the locality of memory access is not taken into consideration, NUMA can cause latency problems for applications.</p>
