As an integrated agency, Bright Blue Day handles both traditional media and new media for its clients, which include Vodafone, HP, Sony, Visa, and BlackBerry.<br /><br />Bright Blue Day moved its client sites to the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public">Rackspace Cloud</a> from a dedicated host at the start of 2011. The agency has about 60 employees, including five software developers.</p><p>&ldquo;We had become very interested in the Cloud, as we&rsquo;d had issues before on dedicated servers,&rdquo; explains Chris Rowe, senior developer at Bright Blue Day. &ldquo;We would have traffic spikes on our sites, and the server couldn&rsquo;t handle it. We liked the idea that on the Rackspace Cloud, you could quickly fire off another server, and we could also reach Rackspace support if we needed anything.&rdquo;</p><h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Searching for the Right Solution for Complex Sites</span></span></h3><p>For Bright Blue Day, Cloud Sites was a good option for many of their smaller sites. &ldquo;But with Cloud Sites, you can only configure so far,&rdquo; says Rowe, and the sites for one major client were going to require some extra planning and configuration.</p><p>Loch Fyne Oysters is a popular Scotland-based retail company, with a sister chain of 38 seafood restaurants throughout the UK. The website caters to the online sales of oysters and other seafood. For the Loch Fyne account, Bright Blue Day needed a flexible and powerful hosting solution.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one company, but there were three sites that needed to work together to share files,&rdquo; says Rowe. The site incorporated two different use cases: <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/websites/">corporate website hosting</a>, as well as a highly-trafficked <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/">e-commerce business</a>.</p><p>Bright Blue Day also needed specialists to manage the servers, and support to provide for Loch Fyne&rsquo;s sites&rsquo; availability. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a relatively small team of developers, and the idea of having to manage servers is just beyond what our team is able to do,&rdquo; says Rowe. &ldquo;Software updates and patches aren&rsquo;t something we can really handle.&rdquo;</p><h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">A Solution for Great Flexibility and Few Worries</span></strong></span></h3><p>Bright Blue Day&rsquo;s Cloud footprint is a fairly straightforward one. They have 20 different clients hosted on Cloud Sites, and Loch Fyne on a 2GB <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/managedcloud/">Windows Cloud Server with Managed Operations</a>. The Loch Fyne sites all live on the same Cloud Server, and the online shop&rsquo;s credit card transactions operate through a third-party payment gateway. The e-commerce site sees about 3,500 customers a day.<br /><br />Because he&rsquo;s using managed Cloud Servers, Rowe hasn&rsquo;t really had to think about his Loch Fyne servers much at all. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done much with web farming, and I haven&rsquo;t had to change the size or anything. We&rsquo;ve been on the managed cloud for four months, and it&rsquo;s been running smoothly, with no problems so far.&rdquo;</p><p>Rowe said that he would recommend the managed Cloud Servers to other businesses without hesitation. &ldquo;The migration help was really useful. We had a few issues migrating, and they were very helpful making the setup work on the new server.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The Cloud also gives us the ability to change quickly,&rdquo; says Rowe. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re running a campaign that ramps up quickly, we can easily add another instance or increase the server size."</p><h3><strong>Managed Operations Support</strong></h3><p>The Managed Operations support is a major plus for Rowe. &ldquo;If there are issues, it&rsquo;s nice to know there&rsquo;s someone to go to 24 hours&mdash;that if there&rsquo;s a problem you don&rsquo;t have to rely on your own knowledge alone. With Rackspace, it&rsquo;s nice to have the reassurance that someone else is looking after that side of things, so you can focus on building your own software.&rdquo;</p><p>For Bright Blue Day, being able to count on Managed Operations isn&rsquo;t just a nice cushion&mdash;it&rsquo;s crucial to ensuring the best possible experience for their customers, and in turn, it&rsquo;s central to their business. &ldquo;As an agency, the Managed Operations gives us an extra level of security for our clients,&rdquo; explains Rowe. &ldquo;Managed Operations is really useful to us because we are an integrated agency; we&rsquo;re not purely digital. It&rsquo;s nice to have another expert when we&rsquo;re launching digital campaigns."</p><p>Rowe has been able to call on different kinds of Rackspace support, depending on the issue. &ldquo;Sometimes I just use the live chat service just to talk to someone, for a quick fix. Other times it&rsquo;s something a Racker has to think about, so I&rsquo;ll submit a ticket, and a Racker always responds to it pretty quickly. One time a Racker rang me up and used a remote desktop to show me how to do something. It was really useful.&rdquo;</p><h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Bottom Line: Saving Money, Manpower, and Headaches</strong></span></h3><p>For Bright Blue Day, Rackspace was a clear winner for their bottom line. &ldquo;Since moving to the Rackspace Cloud, we&rsquo;ve saved quite a bit of money,&rdquo; says Rowe. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve cut our bill in half.&rdquo;</p><p>By using the managed Cloud Servers, the agency also doesn&rsquo;t have to hire a systems administrator, and its software developers don&rsquo;t have to handle server issues. Finally, adds Rowe, &ldquo;Rackspace is more familiar with the problems that are likely to occur, even if we had our own employee who handled servers.&rdquo;</p><p>In the future, Rowe plans to expand his cloud footprint. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to use <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/">Cloud Files </a>for backups, and Cloud Servers for developing. And if we have another big customer, we&rsquo;ll put them on the managed cloud.&rdquo;</p>
