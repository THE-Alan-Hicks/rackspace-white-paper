Their services give manufacturers the support they need to place their products into retail outlets. When Peter Medrano, IT Director at Morgan &amp; Sampson, arrived, he found employees using disparate, consumer email services from different providers. After moving to a single email provider, that provider was bought out by GoDaddy.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything was fine until there was a support issue. You could be down a long time before they&rsquo;d even admit there was a problem,&rdquo; says Peter. Aside from the lack of support with GoDaddy, there was too much downtime and inadequate storage, &ldquo;End users were complaining every week,&rdquo; reports Peter. The company sends about 50 emails to one phone call, making dependable business email vital to their business success. &ldquo;If email is down, we aren&rsquo;t making any money. Email is everyone&rsquo;s main communication tool today. You expect it to work. Just as you expect a dial tone when you pick up the phone,&rdquo; says Peter.</p><p>When Peter began his hunt for a new email host, he sought a reliable business email provider to support their business goals. &ldquo;We are a frugal, well-operated organization actively reinvesting in our future. And, we were looking for the biggest bang for our buck.&rdquo;</p><h3>More Features for Less Money</h3><p>Peter researched Rackspace and was pleased with what he found. After testing a personal domain on Rackspace Email, he was sold. &ldquo;It was like night and day compared to our GoDaddy service, plus, Rackspace Email has more included storage space, great speed, and IMAP access.&rdquo;</p><p>With employees working remotely, IMAP capability was essential. They used GoDaddy&rsquo;s POP service which makes working with email in multiple locations difficult. With Rackspace Email, they have the ability to access their <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/rackspace_email/on_the_web/">updated webmail client</a> from any internet connection or browser. &ldquo;With all the features, it was the only email service I found with everything we needed at a very, very low price. It&rsquo;s been one of the best investments we&rsquo;ve made!&rdquo; Rackspace Email was built for business email users with calendar, contacts, tasks, and notes combined into one intuitive web-based interface.</p><p>According to Peter, &ldquo;Setting up the account and moving over to webmail was simple. No problems whatsoever. The move was painless and went off beautifully.&rdquo; Rackspace provides a dedicated Transition Team to assist new customers with the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/migrations/">transition and migration process</a>.</p><h3>Replaces High Fees with High-Quality Support</h3><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s transparent. People aren&rsquo;t complaining anymore, so I know it&rsquo;s working,&rdquo; says Peter. Their satisfaction with Rackspace is driven by their happiness with their new email service and the tremendous value they get from Rackspace Email. &ldquo;We were actually able to drop the amount we were paying for email and get better service with Rackspace Email,&rdquo; explains Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bill we don&rsquo;t even notice, and extra features have been added at no additional cost,&rdquo; Peter says. Recently, we added 10GB storage and mobile sync to all Rackspace Email mailboxes without increasing fees.</p><p>The value extends to the importance of having a team of email experts available when he needs help. &ldquo;We recently switched ISPs. The ISP said we&rsquo;d have no problems. Of course, we had a problem. And the ISP was dragging their feet to get it resolved. Then, I spoke with a support representative at Rackspace. They went above and beyond by identifying a possible glitch and actually contacting the ISP to get it resolved. I was shocked at the lengths he went to help resolve the issue,&rdquo; shares Peter. That&rsquo;s Fanatical Support in action.</p><p>With email becoming their main communication tool, Peter states, &ldquo;We needed more stability around email, both for the company and for me as the IT Director. We didn&rsquo;t have it before, but we have it now with Rackspace. The service with Rackspace is unbelievable compared to other companies.&rdquo;</p>
