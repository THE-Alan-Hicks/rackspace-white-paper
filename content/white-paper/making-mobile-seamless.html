<h3>Introduction</h3><p>With advancements in technology infrastructure, WiFi availability and application&nbsp;performance, the mobile web is faster than ever. In spite of these improvements,&nbsp;mobile devices sometimes hit dead zones where data access is not available. This can&nbsp;be frustrating, not only for users, but also for businesses who have taken the time to&nbsp;build their mobile app on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">high performing cloud servers</a>.&nbsp;But even with an uninterrupted signal from the tower, there are still challenges with&nbsp;creating a solid user experience. Put simply, mobile experience differs greatly from its&nbsp;desktop counterpart. As you begin to craft a mobile application, consider these seven&nbsp;strategies to help provide the best end-user experience.</p><h3>Creating the Effect of&nbsp;Always Being Connected</h3><p><strong>1. Sync Offline Actions When Back Online</strong></p><p>One strategy is to create the effect of an instant response, even when the device&nbsp;has lost connection to the carrier. This allows the application to continue delighting&nbsp;users without an active network connection. Instagram<sup>®</sup> was one of the first major&nbsp;applications to understand this phenomenon.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram users are still able to “Like” or comment on a photo when their mobile&nbsp;device isn’t connected to a network. Clicking the heart button changes it from white to&nbsp;red, creating the effect that the “Like” is immediately recorded. Users can comment on&nbsp;their friend’s photos, and the comments will be synced when the app connects back&nbsp;to the web. While many apps hang if they can’t connect, adopting a workflow where&nbsp;data can be synced once the smartphone connects back to the tower can improve the&nbsp;overall user experience.</p><p>Inside your team, consider what pieces of data aren’t critical. Allow users to control&nbsp;those aspects when the device is offline and then find a way to update the data when the device is reconnected.</p><p><strong>2. Process Data Locally When It Makes Sense</strong></p><p>With the iPhone<sup>®</sup> 3G, a user could simply say, “Call Joe,” and the phone would call&nbsp;their friend, even without a data connection present. Only a couple of bars of voice&nbsp;service are needed to make a phone call—all of the voice recognition and processing&nbsp;was done locally on the phone.</p><p>Fast forward to Siri<sup>®</sup> and the iPhone5. A user is now required to have a data&nbsp;connection when using the voice command to make a call. The request leaves the&nbsp;phone, it’s processed on a server and then Joe is called. The functionality doesn’t work&nbsp;if the user is in a data dead zone—even if there are enough bars for voice service to&nbsp;actually make a call.</p><p>Combat this frustration by designing a mobile experience that allows some tasks to be&nbsp;completed on the device itself. Processing actions locally may do more than speed up&nbsp;response times when a tower connection is present, it might mean getting the task&nbsp;completed altogether if there’s not a network connection.</p><p><strong>3. Predict and Preload</strong></p><p>Finding a way to predict and preload desired information can make a dropped&nbsp;connection a small bump in the road instead of a major issue. Google<sup>®</sup> does this well&nbsp;in their Chrome browser. As the user searches for information, Google loads the site&nbsp;in the background for the URL that is most likely to be clicked. When a user clicks that&nbsp;URL, the website appears instantly on the screen. The heavy lifting was completed in&nbsp;the background, in advance.</p><p>Look to this idea when developing mobile apps. Whether it’s preloading a map based&nbsp;on the user’s location, or even a group of products this customer is likely to view&nbsp;next, predicting user behavior and downloading data in advance can result in an&nbsp;uninterrupted experience.</p><h3>Maximizing a Mobile Connection</h3><p><strong>4. Transfer the Smallest Amount&nbsp;of Data Possible</strong></p><p>While technologies like LTE have improved the throughput of cellular networks, latency&nbsp;is still a factor. You rarely see the performance of a physical internet connection. For&nbsp;this reason, mobile applications should aim to transfer the smallest amount of data&nbsp;possible to the end device.</p><p>Deliver data faster to mobile devices by shrinking images, reducing video quality and&nbsp;compressing data within API calls. By understanding the device behind the incoming&nbsp;request, the app can serve up the particular content that makes the most sense for&nbsp;its particular screen size. This is the ethos behind the “mobile first” development&nbsp;movement.<sup>2</sup></p><p><strong>5. Adopt a CDN for Storing Data</strong></p><p>A <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/features/?page=cdn#cdn">content delivery network (CDN)</a> is a grouping of geographically dispersed servers&nbsp;that stores multiple copies of data in specific locations. The CDN then delivers the data&nbsp;from a server physically closer to the person making the request. For example, a user&nbsp;in London would receive a file from a server in the U.K. rather than from one in the&nbsp;United States.</p><p>Much has been made about how this feature of the CDN can speed up the delivery&nbsp;of data to the end user. However, the real value of the CDN for mobile apps is that&nbsp;it creates many copies of the data, which can enable a highly requested item to&nbsp;remain available online. Whereas a popular file can overtax a server from a flood of&nbsp;requests, replicating files across the CDN ensures they are always accessible, without&nbsp;overburdening your web servers.</p><p>There are indeed some speed advantages to using a CDN, but the biggest beneficiaries&nbsp;are the low latency, high throughput network connections (such as physically plugging&nbsp;into the web with an Ethernet cord). “It’s true that a CDN might shave off 30ms of&nbsp;load time. However, it isn’t going to matter as much to the person on a smartphone&nbsp;who has to wait 600ms for the data to hop between the tower and their device,”&nbsp;Major Hayden, Rackspace Engineer, says.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean that you should abandon the CDN for storing files needed in&nbsp;your mobile application. While the mobile app may not gain much in terms of speed,&nbsp;you do gain plenty in terms of reliability.</p><h3>Handling High Growth and&nbsp;Securing the App</h3><p><strong>6. Prepare for Horizontal Scaling</strong></p><p>You never know if your mobile application is a success or a bust. However, a deluge of&nbsp;users requires a massive amount of compute power. One way to handle the mounting&nbsp;traffic is to enable your application to scale out horizontally. For each piece of your&nbsp;environment—storage, web or database nodes—make sure that you can acquire more&nbsp;as needed. Scaling up vertically (using larger and larger nodes with more resources) is&nbsp;only a short-term fix and isn’t sustainable.</p><p>While manually scaling can be a pain, there are many different DevOps tools that can&nbsp;help you with this process. Infrastructure automation tools like Chef and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/auto-scale/">Rackspace®&nbsp;Auto Scale</a> are just a couple of options. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/">Rackspace Hybrid Cloud</a> you can employ both dedicated and cloud servers. The hybrid&nbsp;cloud gives you a combination of physical infrastructure to handle the day-to-day&nbsp;load with the ability to burst in the cloud as your mobile app takes off. But it is key to&nbsp;integrate these tools into the application from the start.</p><p><strong>7. Secure Your Mobile-Only APIs</strong></p><p>Mobile applications often have an API designed specifically for smartphone and tablet&nbsp;interaction. It’s tempting for developers to relax security measures, since devices&nbsp;without a command prompt typically hit this particular API. After all, there’s no way for&nbsp;a user to inspect those API calls on their iPhone, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>By setting up a proxy between a smartphone and the web service, users are able to&nbsp;view API calls and identify potential weaknesses. When a soft spot is found, a malicious&nbsp;user can send malevolent API calls while pretending to be a valid mobile device,&nbsp;wreaking havoc within your application. Remember this motto: All traffic is a threat. By&nbsp;not trusting any type of user input—even if it should be from a mobile device—you&nbsp;can put adequate security measures in place to keep your app available users safe.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>As our society becomes more mobile, the demand for mobile applications to work&nbsp;seamlessly increases. Yet even with the bedrock of high performance hardware,&nbsp;mobile apps are often at the mercy of the cellular provider. Additionally, there are&nbsp;unique challenges for mobile applications, even when there is a constant cellular data&nbsp;connection.</p><p>The infrastructure powering the cellular network is evolving and improving. And&nbsp;while cellular speeds and reliability will continue to increase, we can’t yet expect these&nbsp;advancements for a present day mobile application. Adopting some of these best&nbsp;practices and looking at mobile applications differently from desktop apps, you are able&nbsp;to create a more seamless experience for your users.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://getting-real.com/blog/the-secret-to-instagrams-blazing-fast-mobile-design/">http://getting-real.com/blog/the-secret-to-instagrams-blazing-fast-mobile-design/</a><br /><sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/embracing-mobile-first-design/">http://www.rackspace.com/blog/embracing-mobile-first-design/</a></p>
