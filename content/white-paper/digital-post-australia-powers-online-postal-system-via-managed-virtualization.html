<p><strong>CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS: </strong>Digital Post Australia is an enabler of digital communications, connecting Australian businesses with their customers through a secure, trusted service that provides consumers with a free and convenient delivery channel and secure document archive.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>The company was looking to go-to-market quickly with a secure, stable and scalable online environment which could be monitored and managed by their infrastructure hosting partner of choice.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-virtualization/">Managed Virtualisation</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>Digital Post has experienced virtually 100% service uptime since going live with Rackspace.</p>
<h3><strong>Experiencing virtually 100% service uptime since going live with Rackspace. </strong></h3>
<p>As the market leader in providing Australia’s first online postal system since 2012, Digital Post Australia is creating an entirely new model of mail delivery that offers cost savings to businesses and the best possible experience to consumers. The company is a joint venture between one of Australia’s largest communication companies, Computershare, and Zumbox, an innovator in digital postal mail platforms and services based in the United States.</p>
<p>“Digital Post Australia partners with companies that are already producing and preparing their physical mail,” explains Simon Hughes, General Manager at Digital Post Australia. “However, instead of those important documents arriving in your physical mailbox, we deliver a digital version to your digital postbox. Many companies from all over Australia rely on Digital Post for the timely and secure delivery of important customer and shareholder documents to anywhere around the world with access to our service 24/7.”</p>
<p><strong>Getting To Market Quickly</strong></p>
<p>Digital Post realised during their startup phase that, in order to get to market quickly and achieve the desired levels of infrastructure flexibility and scalability, the company would need to engage a hosting partner. “With our focus being on optimisation of our core application technology platform, we required a reliable and trusted partner to help take care of our infrastructure requirements,” says Hughes. “We needed to design and implement a secure, stable, hosted environment in a very short timeframe without compromising quality.”</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the information that Digital Post handles, the focus was finding a hosting provider that could meet their minimum requirements, particularly in relation to information security, including that all data must be hosted in Australia, and associated certifications. Digital Post evaluated each hosting candidate on a number of key factors including the ability to meet unique technical requirements, familiarity with critical technologies, local presence and operational support, and the ability to meet Digital Post’s tight timeframes.</p>
<p>“Rackspace was impressively responsive to our needs and proposed a suitable and well-designed solution in a very short space of time,” explains Hughes. “Their engineers and technical team demonstrated a solid knowledge of key technologies that are critical to our architecture and the sales team came to the table with competitive commercial arrangements. The service levels offered by Rackspace set a very high benchmark and, although we were already aware of the company’s reputation, we received several positive recommendations for Rackspace.”</p>
<p>Although Digital Post had a pre-defined architecture, Rackspace consulted and provided the startup with constructive and informed design recommendations. “The final solution design was significantly influenced by the knowledge of Rackspace’s engineers and was completed in an impressively short period of time,” says Hughes. “Deployment of the solution was just as impressive with the solution being delivered on time and to a very high standard. We now use Rackspace for fully hosted infrastructure and support.”</p>
<p><strong>No Critical Infrastructure Worries</strong></p>
<p>Since building the infrastructure for Digital Post on Rackspace, Hughes goes on to say, “we have experienced virtually 100% service uptime since going live with Rackspace. Our technical team is able to&nbsp;spend far less time monitoring and managing critical infrastructure now and service reports are proactive and regular meaning that we rarely even need to reach out to ask for information.”</p>
<p>Freeing up valuable time by allowing Rackspace to manage, monitor and report on the infrastructure, Digital Post’s team of technologists are able to focus on the heart of the online postal system. “Our technology teams are able to focus their energies to other areas of the business knowing that our critical infrastructure is in good hands,” says Hughes. “The amount of time spent managing infrastructure components is minimal and this is underpinned by confidence in the systems, monitoring and reporting provided by Rackspace.”</p>
<p>As the Digital Post environment grows and becomes more complex, the company envisions utilising thea technical expertise of Rackspace’s engineers and architects to, “assist in the efficient and practical design of even more scalable and flexible solutions,” concludes Hughes. “We are always keen to hear about developments in Rackspace’s service offering as our own business and technology requirements are constantly evolving. And, also see opportunities to augment our own technical security capabilities by complementing these with Rackspace’s security offerings in the future.”</p>
