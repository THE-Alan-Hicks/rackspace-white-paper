<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong><br />
Page load times that are 30% faster than previous, competitive with the world’s leading online retailers.</p>

<p><strong>Rackspace helps mobile solution transform standard websites with industry-leading load times</strong></p>

<p>Boulder, Colorado-based mShopper is a leading global provider of mobile commerce solutions. The company was founded in 2006 by CEO David Gould founded mShopper in 2006.</p>

<p>Online shopping using smartphones and tablets has increased dramatically in recent years — jumping to over 20% of overall retail traffic in the past two years — and “m-commerce” could surpass traditional e-commerce by 2018. mShopper offers retailers a simple and affordable software solution to transform any standard website into a mobile-optimized site.</p>

<p>mShopper’s proprietary technology is platform agnostic, meaning any e-commerce platform — from Magento, to Volution, Shopify, Zen Cart, or any of the dozens of others on the market — can be integrated directly with their mobile platform through the use of data feeds. Working with Rackspace as a hosting provider, mShopper also delivers industry-leading page load times for their customers, further guaranteeing an optimum user experience for their mobile shoppers.</p>

<p><strong>SWITCHING TO RACKSPACE</strong></p>

<p>mShopper’s business model depends on their customers making money in their m-stores. Avoiding downtime is vital. mShopper came to Rackspace after experiencing hardware and support issues with a previous provider. Gould says that although he had heard many good things about Rackspace he was initially nervous about switching, since the stakes were incredibly high.</p>

<p>“My servers are the foundation of my business,” he explains. “It was scary to migrate from where we were, which was stable, to something that was offering a greater potential.” Thankfully, the switch went off without a hitch: “The onboarding process was fantastic,” Gould says. “We got an amazing amount of support, we got all the hardware we needed, and it was all implemented really quickly and very cost efficiently. As a small company, I’m saving a couple thousand dollars a month for way more hardware capacity, and that’s a big deal.”</p>

<p><strong>FASTER LOAD TIMES</strong></p>

<p>The switch to Rackspace has directly benefitted mShopper’s customers through dramatic improvements in load times, a crucial ecommerce success metric. “The Aberdeen Group has found that for every second it takes for a page to load you lose 7% of your traffic,” explains CMO Bob Berger. “With Rackspace we found that page load times were improving. Right away we saw a nice spike in performance across our customer base.”</p>

<p>mShopper’s average load times have become competitive with the world’s leading online retailers, citing data from the 2014 Mobile 500 report: “Of the top 28, the elite in the Mobile 500 report, our average customer load time puts us at about number four,” he explains. “We’re delivering page load times to any retailer who becomes our customer that are almost competitive with somebody who spent millions of dollars doing that.”</p>

<p>“If we had to build our IT infrastructure from the ground up to match what Rackspace Managed Cloud services do for us, we’d be years behind where we are today. A lot of the money that we’re using right now to help drive sales and improve the front end of our product would be spent on server infrastructure and internal IT staff. The service level we get from you guys is incredible, delivering six nines of reliability to us, which would probably take an IT staff of four or five guy’s minimum working round the clock. That would be very expensive compared to what we get from Rackspace.”</p>

<p><strong>EFFORTLESS SUPPORT</strong></p>

<p>Gould says he was initially drawn to Rackspace because of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ge7rotzBI0">reputation for support</a>, and that they haven’t disappointed. As a CEO, he defines excellent support as the type that never requires his attention. “I know I’m going to need support, and want it to happen without my time and my energy,” he explains. Rackspace has been stellar in this regard, he reports. “I’m not involved in network management but in my inbox I see support tickets. We open tickets, they’re closed. I see it all the time and it’s phenomenal. As a manager, I don’t have to allocate time and energy to it, but it’s getting done.”</p>

<p><strong>A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION</strong></p>

<p>Gould says he wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Rackspace to peers given the huge advantages it has brought to mShopper: “It’s got great support, great value – I’m saving a couple thousand dollars a month for way more capacity, way more capable hardware – and getting started was easy. Every step has been very easy with Rackspace.”</p>

<p>Berger agrees: “I have a background working with cloud-based and SaaS-based products and working with Rackspace has probably been one of the most enjoyable, in terms of professionalism, in getting the work done, and getting things delivered on time. It has also just been really enjoyable to watch everything improve over a period of time. So I’d highly recommend Rackspace to anybody who wants to do a SaaS based product.”</p>
