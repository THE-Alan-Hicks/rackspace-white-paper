Though the company has grown dramatically&mdash;now operating 16 separate websites and booking $28 million in sales last year&mdash;NTS remains a lean organization. It has just 20 employees, and only one of them is devoted to IT.<br /><br />As an e-commerce company, NTS (<a href="http://www.ntsupply.com/">ntsupply.com</a>) is entirely dependent on the functionality of its websites. And to ensure they remain up and running virtually non-stop, the company relies on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace Hosting</a>.<br /><br />&ldquo;There are only two or three companies we do business with that I can endorse without hesitation, and Rackspace is at the top of the list,&rdquo; says Tyler Dishman, NTS Co-founder and current Vice President of Technology.</p><h3>FOCUS ON SERVICE MAKES RACKSPACE STAND OUT</h3><p>National Trade Supply, once ranked the fourth fastest-growing e-commerce business in the U.S., has depended on third-party hosting from the very start. Dishman developed the site&rsquo;s content and had it hosted by a small, local company in Indianapolis. Looking back, he says that initial hosting experience was ill-advised. But he really didn&rsquo;t know any better.<br /><br />&ldquo;Once, on the day after Thanksgiving, our whole site shut down. The server had crashed. It should have been a big sales day for us, and we had no way of doing business. Zero transactions. And when I talked with the support people, I wasn&rsquo;t sure they knew much more than I did about how to fix the problem.&rdquo;<br /><br />When Dishman began searching for a new hosting company, his first priority was finding a partner that was service-oriented. He surveyed larger companies that he knew from e-commerce trade shows and heard glowing recommendations for Rackspace.<br /><br />&ldquo;Rackspace was exactly what I was looking for. Their focus on service&mdash;what they call &lsquo;Fanatical Support&rsquo;&mdash;really attracted me to them. And they&rsquo;ve delivered on that promise time and again.&rdquo;<br /><br />NTS started with an entry-level server from Rackspace&mdash;and still found it offered more bandwidth, more disk space, and better support than NTS had received in the past.<br /><br />&ldquo;One of the things I liked about Rackspace was that they always give you a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/">dedicated server</a>,&rdquo; he notes. &ldquo;With smaller companies, you couldn&rsquo;t tell what you were getting.&rdquo;<br /><br />He notes that the local hosting company NTS initially used had just three employees. &ldquo;So every problem had to be solved by those three people, those three brains. Rackspace seems to have armies of people who can contribute ideas. If you&rsquo;ve got a firewall problem, they&rsquo;ve got another army.&rdquo;<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s web traffic now averages roughly 1000 transactions a day, and the increased traffic has never been an issue for Rackspace. Dishman quickly acknowledges he didn&rsquo;t know anything about security best practices when he designed the early NTS sites. Over time, vulnerabilities were discovered in the way the software interacted with the hardware.<br /><br />&ldquo;Rackspace was very responsive and efficient at shutting down that problem.&rdquo; Afterwards, Dishman added a firewall to the site based on Rackspace&rsquo;s recommendation and restricted web server login access to NTS&rsquo; own offices.<br /><br />He has also added more bandwidth and memory from time to time as the company&rsquo;s business and web traffic have grown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never hesitated to add upgrades when we think they&rsquo;re appropriate,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt we&rsquo;re getting good value from Rackspace.&rdquo; In fact, he says, the last time he evaluated the cost of NTS&rsquo; hosting service from Rackspace, he was amazed at the value. &ldquo;The cost of our Rackspace hosting is an embarrassingly small part of the overall cost of running the company&mdash;a small fraction of one percent. And frankly, the whole company hinges on it.&rdquo;<br /><br />What makes the value even more impressive is the expert and free <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup></a>. &ldquo;Obviously, customer service is a big part of our own company and its success. So when I consider what Rackspace has done, I find it very impressive that they&rsquo;ve made support such a central focus. Their people are always helpful and responsive, they never question my actions and never hesitate to help,&rdquo; Dishman says. &ldquo;And they communicate well with me. To be able to get on the phone when you&rsquo;ve got a critical issue, and talk to someone who really seems to know what they&rsquo;re doing&mdash;that&rsquo;s very reassuring.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dishman says he doesn&rsquo;t abuse the privilege. If he thinks he can solve a problem himself, he does. But when he asks for help, he really needs it. And he&rsquo;s never been disappointed. &ldquo;They not only work to solve my problem until it&rsquo;s fixed, but they share their ideas and process. They&rsquo;re very descriptive. So with any luck, I can learn from them for the next problem that occurs.&rdquo;<br /><br />Looking ahead, Dishman knows that as National Trade Supply grows and evolves, Rackspace will be more than able to provide whatever infrastructure it needs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably be a Rackspace customer for life.&rdquo;</p>
