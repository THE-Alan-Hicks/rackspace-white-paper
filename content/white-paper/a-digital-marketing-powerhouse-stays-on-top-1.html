Named Ad Age&rsquo;s Top Digital Agency for the past two years, the firm prides itself on providing clients with innovative e-commerce and content-management solutions.<br /><br />Acquity Group first chose Rackspace for its scalability, security and support. Thrilled with the experience, they now have more than 250 devices at Rackspace and take advantage of dedicated, cloud and hybrid hosting solutions. As the company has grown, they&rsquo;ve found <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/advisory_services/">Rackspace Advisory Services</a> to be an indispensable resource in maximizing the efficiency of their infrastructure while keeping client information secure.</p><p><strong>RELYING ON RACKSPACE</strong></p><p>From their first foray into virtualization, Acquity Group has relied on Rackspace Advisory Services&rsquo; team to guide their IT strategy. According to vice president of national technical services Kevin Ellenwood, &ldquo;Advisory Services has always been absolutely necessary for us. We&rsquo;ve always relied on having people that understand our business, that understand data center needs and necessities, and that are smarter than us in those areas.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ellenwood sees Rackspace Advisory Services critical to his business&rsquo; success. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re absolutely an extension of our business,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I treat my Rackspace team no differently than I do anybody else that works on my team directly. We set the same expectations for them. And, you know, they don&rsquo;t let me down. We&rsquo;ve changed individuals on our team within Rackspace, and the one thing that&rsquo;s been constant is the service that we&rsquo;ve been getting has remained consistent.&rdquo;<br /><br />IT Evolution Workshops allow Acquity Group and Rackspace Advisory Services to brainstorm IT strategies and solutions to help ensure their business is the best it can be. Together, the two teams customize an agenda based on Acquity Group&rsquo;s specific challenges and needs. While Acquity Group enters the conversation with certain priorities, Ellenwood says, &ldquo;We also leave flexibility for the Rackspace team to come back and say, &lsquo;these are concepts that we think are going to make your business better; they&rsquo;re going to make you guys stronger. If we sit down and talk to you about these things, it&rsquo;s going to make all of us smarter about what we do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><strong>LEVERAGING NETAPP AND CRITICAL APPLICATION SERVICES FOR AN EDGE IN THE ADOBE CQ FIELD</strong></p><p>Most recently, Acquity Group consulted with Rackspace Advisory Services for help with formulating a storage strategy that would allow them to use their NetApp Network Attached Storage (NAS) device more efficiently. Together, they devised a plan to leverage Acquity Group&rsquo;s NAS appliance as a media files repository for a client&rsquo;s migration to Adobe CQ.<br /><br />&ldquo;We had a very specific business requirement from one of our larger customers,&rdquo; Ellenwood says. &ldquo;They wanted to move all of their digital assets over to the CQ environment. That included more than a hundred years of digital product assets. So you&rsquo;re talking about a lot of images, a lot of media files. We wanted to know: How can we do that and not have to charge them for 30 terabytes of storage per server? How can we do that with a shared file drive?&rdquo;<br /><br />Rackspace Advisory Services helped Acquity Group use their NAS appliance to save their client a significant amount of money. &ldquo;Our storage solution reduces the amount of disk requirements for our large enterprise customers by more than 80%,&rdquo; Ellenwood explains. &ldquo;I think it makes us a lot more competitive in the CQ space and in the CQ hosting space. We&rsquo;re already a very large partner on the Adobe side&ndash;we were their partner of the year last year&ndash;but we still need to look at what we&rsquo;re doing with their products and make sure we&rsquo;re as innovative as possible. Rackspace Advisory Services really helped us to do that through the best use of this one specific device.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>KEEPING CLIENTS SECURE IN THE PRIVATE CLOUD</strong><br /><br />In addition to relying on Rackspace for the efficiency of Acquity Group&rsquo;s delivery of e-commerce and content-management solutions for enterprise clientele, Acquity Group depends on the Managed Virtualization environ- ment to help keep client information secure. &ldquo;When I came to Acquity Group,&rdquo; Ellenwood explains, &ldquo;we were running a physical-hardware-based e-commerce platform that was hosted at Rackspace. One of the first things I did was move from a physical, dedicated infrastruc- ture into a private-cloud infrastructure, virtualizing all our machines and our environments. We engaged with Rackspace Advisory Services on virtualization strategy.&rdquo;<br /><br />Managed Virtualization allows Acquity Group to customize their environment to suit their security needs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve met our security requirements within our virtualized solution,&rdquo; Ellenwood says.&ldquo; We can make certain security guarantees. We control who has access to the network infrastructure and what they can do with the network infrastructure. Our environment goes through our annual PCI audits, our security audits, and we have a dedicated security staff on our team, along with the Rackspace team, that ensures the security of that environment. We are running large brands in our environment right now, whether it&rsquo;s in our content or our commerce platform. Like all global platforms, we are getting attacks on a daily basis, yet we&rsquo;ve never had a breach, and we&rsquo;ve always been able to react in a timely matter to any type of issue that has come up. Our Rackspace team is on top of it and our security team is on top of it.&rdquo;<br /><br />The flexibility and scalability of Acquity&rsquo;s virtual environment allows them to uphold this standard of security even while handling massive data loads. Ellenwood recalls a major client&rsquo;s IPO, the nation&rsquo;s largest at the time. &ldquo;We were running their investor-relations data on our system,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We were hammered with attacks, because if you can disrupt something of that size and get on the news, that&rsquo;s a big win for people that are looking to do this type of thing. Even though we&rsquo;ve had attacks, we&rsquo;ve had zero outage, zero downtime, and a very reactive team. All of that comes from spending an awful lot of time with my team, working with our Rackspace team, working with Rackspace Advisory Services, and leveraging that relationship.&rdquo;</p><h3>FANATICAL SUPPORT<sup>&reg;</sup></h3><p>Working with Rackspace Advisory Services allows Acquity Group to better support their own clients by offering both innovation and security. Ellenwood says, &ldquo;Rackspace&rsquo;s reliability gives Acquity Group the freedom to focus on creating great apps and onboarding customers without worrying about infrastructure.&rdquo; Rackspace&rsquo;s experience-based expertise also gives Ellenwood the confidence to try new things, and with the Rackspace portfolio of offerings, there are always plenty of new things to try.<br /><br />Above all, Rackspace&rsquo;s commitment to outstanding customer service, branded <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support</a>, keeps Acquity Group loyal. &ldquo;Our mission is not that different, from a support perspective,&rdquo; Ellenwood says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unacceptable for us to have any type of outage, and quite frankly, our team at Rackspace has the same attitude. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here. I expect that from our service providers, and we&rsquo;re on the same page.&rdquo;</p>
