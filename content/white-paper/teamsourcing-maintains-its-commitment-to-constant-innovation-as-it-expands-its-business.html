<p><strong>CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS: </strong>Provides content and services to mobile carriers throughout Latin America, using the latest generation cellular technology.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>TeamSourcing wants to offer its clients the latest technology while maintaining secure and reliable service. They need a stable and flexible platform that can keep up with its development team.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE® SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/">Rackspace Private Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Public Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/openstack_software/">OpenStack</a> saves TeamSourcing money, allowing them to use fewer machines and gives them the confidence to offer an ever-expanding set of solutions to their clients.</p>
<h3><strong>The mobile content provider relies on Rackspace services and support to deliver the latest mobile technology to its clients around the continent.</strong></h3>
<p>TeamSourcing is a global company based in Ecuador that has become one of the leading providers of mobile content and services in Latin America. When CEO Armando Coronel founded TeamSourcing in 2002, its 5-person team was focused principally on the Ecuadorian market. Since then, TeamSourcing has grown to a team of nearly 60, and its reputation for world-class products and services has helped it expand throughout the region. TeamSourcing now does business in 10 Latin American countries, working with mobile operators in Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia.</p>
<p>TeamSourcing has become a recognized leader in the Latin American market and has formed strategic alliances with many of the top mobile content creators, media distributors, and service providers in Europe and Latin America, which allows the company to stay on top of the latest technology and provide a large and ever-growing array of products and services to its clients. As the company continues its expansion, it uses Rackspace products to iterate quickly in response to market demands while saving money and providing the stability and security its customers have come to expect.</p>
<p><strong>TeamSourcing’s Developers Love the Cloud</strong></p>
<p>TeamSourcing’s developers take full advantage of the cloud as a platform for testing new ideas and changing configurations on the fly. “Our passion is doing things quickly,” explains Giacomo Orizzonte, Head of Production for TeamSourcing. “We don’t set limits. We are always going to offer new things to the companies we work for even if we don’t have them yet. Our passion is to sell these new things and then create them extremely quickly. We have an excellent development team that is able to work very quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>Rackspace Has Helped TeamSourcing Save Money as it Grows</strong></p>
<p>Its reputation for results and innovation has helped TeamSourcing generate projects outside of Ecuador and move into Latin America’s largest markets. Rackspace has helped the company maintain a high level of service as it expands. “We’ve grown along with Rackspace,” Orizzonte explains, “increasing service along with our market needs.” TeamSourcing began by using Rackspace dedicated servers and has been moving steadily towards the cloud, first taking advantage of public cloud services like Cloud Files. The company now runs a Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack. Orizzonte explains that Rackspace’s services have been a central part of the company’s plan for continued growth. “Right now we have a mixed infrastructure using a range of Rackspace technologies,” he explains, but “we are directing our growth right now towards the cloud and we’d like to eventually have all the services in OpenStack.”</p>
<p>Why the shift? In large part for economic reasons: “I don’t know the numbers,” Orizzonte concedes, “but I know Rackspace has been a huge help. Especially with all the new challenges we’ve had since we increased our services and products last year. We’ve started offering mobile banking apps, and that’s forced us to have many more servers, so OpenStack has reduced our costs hugely. We’ve gone from a traditional infrastructure of having one physical server for each service to what we have now, a few physical servers that provide a huge number of instances through OpenStack, and that leads to incredible savings.”</p>
<p><strong>Stability, Security, and Support</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the savings derived from optimizing its server architecture, TeamSourcing values its relationship with Rackspace for the stability and security it provides, which can be passed along to its clients. “We came to Rackspace because we were looking for a host that would give us a certain amount of security,” Orizzonte explains. This is crucial for helping the company maintain its reputation and its strong relationships with its clients. As Orizzonte points out, TeamSourcing’s products and services help its clients – the cellular operators – attract new customers and keep their current customers satisfied. “We give the carriers high-quality, off- brand products that they can sell as their own,” he explains. “We need to keep our relationships with the carriers at 100%, and to keep service at 100%, so that they can give their clients – the end users – stable and reliable service.”</p>
<p>Above all, Orizzonte praises Rackspace customer service, and especially the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/whyrackspace/">Fanatical Support®</a> which he says has facilitated the company’s growth and been tremendously valuable to his team. “We came to Rackspace because we were looking for security,” he says “but the reason why we have stayed with Rackspace is the excellent service they’ve given us, which has grown wonderfully. We’ve never felt abandoned, and that’s why we’ve stayed with them. It’s something that we truly love about Rackspace.”</p>
<p><strong>Support in Spanish</strong></p>
<p>When asked about Rackspace initiatives to expand its presence in Latin America, Orizzonte takes a positive view, pointing out that he doesn’t know of any service provider in Latin America with Rackspace’s size and capabilities, and certainly none that provides the Fanatical Support that TeamSourcing values so highly. He points out that his own team has already been the beneficiary of Rackspace’s increased presence on the continent, noting the growth of the Latin American team (LATAM). “Now we receive support from the LATAM team , who are really fantastic. They’ve helped us grow. We have technical assistance and support in Spanish, which is really wonderful for us.”</p>
<p>Would Orizzonte recommend Rackspace to other Latin American firms? “Absolutely,” he says. “I would absolutely recommend Rackspace as a technology service provider and as an infrastructure provider. The experience we’ve had with them has been magnificent and we recommend Rackspace to all of our industry peers.”</p>
