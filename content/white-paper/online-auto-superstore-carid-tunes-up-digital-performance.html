CARiD.com caters to all levels, from the DIY home mechanic to custom shops and dealers.</p>

<p><strong>CHALLENGES</strong>: Success in the aftermarket parts and accessories online market demands convenience, reliable product data, and attentive customer service. To compete, the company needs to deliver information and online product offerings to a rapidly expanding global audience faster, but faces limitations with its legacy systems.</p>

<p><strong>RACKSPACE® SOLUTION:  </strong><a href="https://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/">Rackspace Managed Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/?cm_mmc=PPCCloudBU-_-Google-_-broad-_-php+host">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/">Hybrid Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files">Cloud Files</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing">Cloud Load Balancers</a></p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME</strong>: With the support of Rackspace, CARiD.com delivers an always-on, state-of-the-art, personalized customer experience, optimized for clients.</p>

<h3><strong>While Rackspace focuses on IT infrastructure on a Hybrid Cloud.</strong></h3>

<p>New Jersey-based CARiD supplies the best auto components and accessories from top providers. The company’s online ecommerce site CARiD.com offers exterior and interior accessories for cars, trucks, and SUVs, as well as performance parts, automotive lighting items, wheels and tires, and replacement parts.</p>

<p>CARiD.com is the industry’s leading cutting edge superstore for everything automotive, committed to the consumer online shopping experience. CARiD differentiates the brand on delivering the highest level of customer service through call-center representatives, responsive online staff and efficient social media and other marketing-driven relationship tools.</p>

<p>“Since we connect consumers to automotive brand manufacturers whose expertise is not ecommerce, at CARiD we strive to energize manufacturer brands and their product assortment,” explains Len Stavish, COO at CARiD. “It is at this intersection where our technology, business processes and people make the difference. We provide great products and the very best product information and fitment data in the industry, while assuring the client has a great experience.”</p>

<p><strong><strong>A Faster, More Competitive Marketplace</strong></strong></p>

<p>With the global automotive ecommerce marketplace faster and more competitive than ever, consumers expect reliable performance and relevant information on demand and in formats convenient to wherever and whenever they want it.</p>

<p>“Our development team are critical thinkers who collectively ensure that our automotive everything superstore is presented in a variety of forms that conveniently empower visitors,” said Stavish.</p>

<p>The shopping pattern CARiD pays close attention to these days is the Millennial demographic’s comfort with conducting its business over mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.</p>

<p>“Millennials represent the empowered and self-sufficient future of our business, which has consistently grown up and to the right, year over year,” said Stavish. “With such explosive growth, we made the decision to identify and partner with a premier dedicated and cloud-based hosted platform service provider. When a Rackspace exists, it didn’t make sense for us to handle our IT infrastructure and support expense in-house.”</p>

<p><strong>Enabling Performance and Satisfaction</strong></p>

<p>“For CARiD, hosting with Rackspace means that we maintain greater than 99% uptime 24x7x365,” said Stavish. “To a global consumer base, this is essential. If we are not there for clients, they’ll go elsewhere. Knowing that our CARiD superstore is always accessible at any time allows me to sleep at night knowing that we have taken the right care for our clients and business.”</p>

<p>The CARiD team uses a Rackspace architecture consisting of dedicated database servers connected to multiple cloud web servers, allowing the company to deliver relevant information, useful online tools and the latest technology to a give users quick, easy access, and consistent performance with no delays.</p>

<p>“Knowing that you do not need to carry the internal IT infrastructure and support cost allows for our vendors to have confidence that their brands and their products are being given all the online uptime possible,” said Stavish. “We have been able to quickly activate servers without upfront cost, as well as add capacity.”</p>

<p><strong>Changes Without Compromising Speed</strong></p>

<p>CARiD reports that the Rackspace relationship has helped to simplify their IT architecture solution. With 24x7x365 engineering support, the CARiD team is more confident.</p>

<p>“Rackspace has been a solid strategic business partner,” said Stavish. “They have good people and processes in place to help make our business interactions efficient and effective. It’s great when you know that you have a dedicated partner, and people who care about your success.”</p>

<p>CARiD views Rackspace as key in helping remove barriers that previously confronted the company. “Before Rackspace, it would be difficult to make changes without compromising speed,” concludes Stavish. “With Rackspace, we’re able to save time and effort. Working with Rackspace means greater flexibility, more space for growth and lower costs going forward.”</p>
