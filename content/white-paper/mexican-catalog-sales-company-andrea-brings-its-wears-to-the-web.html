<p><strong>CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS:</strong> With a 40-year history in the shoe business, Andrea is  a Mexican catalog sales company that markets shoes, lingerie, clothing and beauty products all across the country through a team of affiliated salespeople, aiming to harness the power of technology for its growing business.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> When it came time to digitize their catalog for the web, Andrea’s IT team realized they needed more bandwidth for their website to operate as intended: they needed the site, full of high-quality images, to load quickly and be a reliable business tool for their many sales affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE</strong><strong>® </strong><strong>SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/">Rackspace Managed Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/security/firewalls/">Firewall</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect/">RackConnect®</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>Andrea now has a fully functioning website, with consistent performance and sufficient bandwidth to run all required services. Their relationship with Rackspace, and especially the support received from the Spanish-speaking division, gives Andrea confidence, not only in their website, but in the future of their business and the role that technology can play in the years to come.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace helps company get its online services up and running via managed cloud.</strong></h3>
<p>Andrea is a catalog sales company that markets shoes, lingerie, clothing, and beauty products all over Mexico. With a 40-year history and strong national roots, Andrea proudly identifies itself as 100% Mexican. The company got its start in 1973 with a single high output shoe workshop in Mexico City. Just three years later, after successfully advertising their shoes in brochures, the company hit on the idea of catalog sales and launched the business model that has brought them steady growth over the past four decades. Over the years Andrea has added new products, expanded production facilities and opened branch offices all over the country, with 130 offices currently in operation in Mexico and, more recently, an additional 14 branches in the US.</p>
<p>The company does not rely on direct sales to consumers but instead on a vast team of affiliated salespeople all over Mexico, who use Andrea’s products to start their own small businesses. Andrea refers to these affiliates, their direct clients, as their “stars” and the company uses its branch offices to centralize all the different services that affiliates need to run their businesses with maximum flexibility, whether they are focused on door-to-door sales, network marketing, or have a dedicated shop or stall in a local market.</p>
<p><strong>Going Digital with Rackspace</strong></p>
<p>Andrea first discovered Rackspace when they began to digitize their catalog for the web and realized that they needed more bandwidth for a functional website — one that would load images quickly and serve as a reliable business tool for their sales affiliates. Guillermo Carlin, Andrea’s IT Infrastructure Production Manager, says they first tried looking for solutions in Mexico, but found they were all too expensive. When they heard about Rackspace, they were drawn not only by the pricing, but the company’s reputation as one of the top service providers in the US.</p>
<p>Both Carlin and Agapito Servin, Andrea’s IT Infrastructure Coordinator, say the relationship has been a blessing from the beginning. Andrea now uses Rackspace Cloud Servers, through RackConnect, and the IT team has been extremely happy with the results. “We didn’t have a hosting solution before Rackspace, so they really fulfilled an important need for us,” says Servin. “The [Rackspace] solution has been excellent,” he adds. “Everything has worked perfectly. We haven’t had a single problem up to now, not with bandwidth, or with service, or with the servers. Everything works.”</p>
<p><strong>Confident About the Future</strong></p>
<p>Andrea’s leaders say that not only has Rackspace improved their website and current business, but the relationship has given them confidence for the future, bolstering their commitment to harness the power of technology in the years to come. “Here at Andrea we have a promising future that’s really dependent on technology,” explains Carlin, “and Rackspace is part of that strategy.”</p>
<p>Software Development Manager Patty Ponce agrees, saying that interacting with the Rackspace experts and observing the team in action left her with a very positive impression. “[Rackspace] really inspires confidence,” she explains. “There’s a whole team working in the background, and you can see that they have a great deal of knowledge.” Ponce says the relationship has allowed Andrea to focus on core business and on expansion: “As a business, we were</p>
<p>used to trying to manage everything in-house, but now we have the confidence that we can begin offering new services, and be supported by a company with experience at the global level. It really opens the doors to a new era of growth.”</p>
<p><strong>A Focus on Service</strong></p>
<p>Both Carlin and Servin highlight customer service as the single most impressive aspect of Rackspace as a company, saying that their interactions with the Rackspace team have been consistently helpful and mentioning that they really appreciate receiving support in their native language. “The service is excellent,” says Servin. “Aside from the fact that they all speak Spanish, they’re very attentive to everything, every service ticket I send out. They’re always on top of it.”</p>
<p>Carlin says he wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Rackspace to anyone looking for a hosting provider, because the focus on service sets it apart from other companies. “They’re not just in it for the sale,” he insists. “The Rackspace team really cares about you. They have the knowledge, the experience, and the capabilities to give your business results, and to help you find whatever you are looking for, but it’s not just the work they do, it’s the special something they have in their service.”</p>
<p>When asked what recommendation he might give to industry peers considering similar services, Carlin says: “I’d say, if you already do your work well, with Rackspace you can do it even better. You can try other data centers, in your region or in the US, but it’s really worth trying with Rackspace, because it’s not just the work they do, it’s the extra level of service they give that helps you do things better.”</p>
