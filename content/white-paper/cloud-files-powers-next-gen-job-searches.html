Their website features developer portfolios &mdash; updated in real time as projects progress &mdash; as well as company profiles that cover everything developers need to know about prospective employers.<br /><br />With a matchmaking mentality, the company emphasizes quality over quantity and places a premium on developer-employer compatibility. &ldquo;If you go to Monster,&rdquo; says cofounder Brad Montgomery, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get a hundred r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, but maybe zero hits out of those hundred. We want to give you two r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that are both awesome fits for you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Work for Pie&rsquo;s team may be small &mdash; consisting solely of cofounder Brad Montgomery and CEO Cliff McKinney &mdash; but the company&rsquo;s potential is huge. Rackspace Cloud Servers and Cloud Files have allowed them to compete in a crowded field, maximizing power and scalability on a minimal budget.</p><h3>PREMIUM POWER ON A BOOTSTRAP BUDGET</h3><p>Though Work for Pie was founded in 2011, Montgomery has been a Rackspace customer since 2009, hosting his personal work on Cloud Servers. He&rsquo;s been so impressed with the service that server hosting&rsquo;s been a no-brainer ever since: &ldquo;Any new project, that&rsquo;s where we go,&rdquo; he says.<br /><br />In addition to Montgomery&rsquo;s history with Rackspace, affordability and scalability were major factors in Work for Pie&rsquo;s decision to cloud their latest venture. &ldquo;We're not completely bootstrapped, but we're running our tech stack as if we were, so affordable services are a really big deal,&rdquo; says Montgomery. &ldquo;We haven't yet seen really large-scale traffic, but having the option to scale up when we need it is very important.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I think the &lsquo;pay for what you use&rsquo; model is a really cost-effective option for small startups,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;and the flexibility of Cloud Servers really lets us get our product built and deployed much more quickly&mdash;we can automate provisioning, configuration, and deployment in a way that's much easier than what we'd be doing if we had dedicated hardware.&rdquo;<br /><br />Once a startup itself, Rackspace is particularly attuned to the needs of new companies, and Work for Pie experienced the company&rsquo;s commitment to growing businesses firsthand. &ldquo;We went through a startup accelerator program here in Memphis called <a href="http://www.seedhatchery.com/">Seed Hatchery</a>, and they were actually part of the <a href="http://www.rackspacestartups.com/seedhatchery/index.html">Rackspace Startup Program</a>,&rdquo; McKinney says. &ldquo;Rackspace is doing a really good job supporting startup ecosystems all over the place.&rdquo;</p><h3>BUILDING A STRONG VISUAL IDENTITY WITH RACKSPACE CLOUD FILES</h3><p>The team began building Work for Pie on Rackspace Cloud Servers. &ldquo;We have a web-based app that is written in Python and uses Django,&rdquo; McKinney explains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a very simple architecture. We use Cloud Servers to power a PostgreSQL database and application servers on top of that.&rdquo; Eventually, they decided to add Rackspace Cloud Files to store and serve all of the media on their design-conscious site.<br /><br />While most job-search sites are heavy on text and light on looks, Work for Pie&rsquo;s design incorporates colorful infographics and allows both employers and developers to display numerous photographs and images on their profiles. Work for Pie uses Cloud Files for &ldquo;images that our users upload &mdash; avatars, photos of office space, company logos, that sort of thing &mdash; as well as our Javascript, our CSS, and any of our own images, background images, and other parts of our website,&rdquo; according to Montgomery.<br /><br />&ldquo;Cloud Files lets us separate our file storage from our computing power,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This separation of concerns allows us to build and maintain a more flexible infrastructure and keep costs down while having the ability to scale up within minutes. That&rsquo;s how a two-man startup can quickly build reliable services that compete with much larger companies.&rdquo;</p><h3>CLOUD FILES CLOBBERS THE COMPETITION</h3><p>While they also considered Amazon S3, Cloud Files&rsquo; <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/open-cloud/">open-source availability</a>, reliable Akamai CDN, and convenience ultimately won out. Rackspace Cloud Files&rsquo; extensive, constantly updated code libraries were a major draw. Cloud Files&rsquo; standards-based API supports Java, .NET, PHP, Ruby, and Python bindings. Montgomery says, &ldquo;We're a Python shop, and having high-quality Python libraries for the Cloud Files API &mdash; both command-line tools and tools to integrate with Django &mdash; made Rackspace an easy choice.&rdquo;<br /><br />Montgomery was also impressed by the reputation of <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/technology/?page=cdn">Cloud Files Akamai CDN</a>. &ldquo;Rackspace Cloud Files is backed by a reliable, high-quality CDN,&rdquo; Montgomery says. &ldquo;I'd heard nothing but good things from other customers, and files can be served over SSL.&rdquo;<br /><br />Finally, says Montgomery, Rackspace Cloud Files is convenient: &ldquo;It's really nice to have both management tools &mdash; web-based dashboards, et cetera &mdash; and billing combined into one service.&rdquo;</p><h3>SUPERIOR STABILITY AND FANATICAL SUPPORT</h3><p>Rackspace Cloud Files&rsquo; and Servers&rsquo; stability mean that Work for Pie has rarely needed to make use of <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support</a>, but Montgomery is glad to know he&rsquo;ll have a helping hand whenever he needs it. &ldquo;Rackspace's service has been so reliable that I've only once needed support for Work for Pie,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This was with regards to serving CDN content over SSL and was quickly resolved during a chat session.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It's nice to have issues resolved in minutes-to-hours instead of days-to-weeks,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason Rackspace advertises Fanatical Support. My experience with other companies has not been nearly as expedient or helpful.&rdquo;<br /><br />Will Rackspace continue to be Montgomery and Work for Pie&rsquo;s go-to? Absolutely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so pleased with Rackspace that I have recommended these services to others,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great. I&rsquo;m a happy camper.&rdquo;</p>
