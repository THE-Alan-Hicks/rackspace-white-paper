Today, it is a privately held company with over 150 employees in the U.S. and Canada. Excentus has leveraged its insight into fuel customer behavior and markets to fill a new niche – administering fuel-related cross marketing and loyalty programs. Through these programs, run by Excentus or branded by Excentus customers, consumers earn reward points through purchases at grocery stores or other retailers that are redeemable for gasoline discounts. With its rapidly expanding Fuel RewardsTM program, Excentus' retail partners are effectively competing and growing market share by saving their loyal customers over $100 million to-date on their gasoline purchases. By increasing in-store sales, these programs deliver considerable value to participating retailers.<br /><br />Behind the scenes, however, these program applications demand a highly available and secure technology infrastructure. Customers often redeem loyalty points immediately after they earn them and Excentus’ systems have to keep up. That means that data transmission between retailers’ point of sale systems (where customers earn points) and fuel operators (where customers redeem their points) must be both flawless and real time. “We need to make discounts available within 60-180 seconds after a retail sale is complete,” notes Mike Melson, Sr. VP of Technical Operations at Excentus.<br /><br />The infrastructure must also have ample capacity to accommodate a high volume of transactions—over a million and a half per day during the holiday season.<br /><br />Excentus meets these objectives through the Rackspace portfolio of managed hosting solutions.</p><h3>IMPRESSED WITH RACKSPACE RESOURCES</h3><p>The company’s original decision to outsource its infrastructure was driven by its corporate business model according to Melson. “Much of our growth has been organic,” he explains. “We grow by reinvesting revenue.”</p><p>Excentus didn’t believe that it made fiscal sense to sink money into a data center—especially given how important it is for the infrastructure to be operational 24x7. “It would have added considerable headcount, particularly since we would need redundancy in each specialization,” Melson says.<br /><br />Its first hosting vendor wasn’t Rackspace. “We started with another hosting provider,” Melson says. It was not a positive experience. “The resources assigned to us were spread so thin, they could not respond to us in a timely fashion.” The vendor also didn’t seem interested in where Excentus was headed strategically.<br /><br />So Excentus put out an RFP, and Rackspace emerged as the leading candidate. “Our technology team was very pleased with the resources Rackspace brought to the table,” Melson says. When Excentus directors began asking in-depth questions about how Rackspace would set up the environment, Rackspace brought in Oracle, Linux, Storage Area Network technology, and network systems specialists to respond to those questions.<br /><br />Rackspace also conveyed its interest in learning about Excentus’ business. “They knew that if they understood our business, they would better understand our technical staff’s concerns,” Melson explains.</p><h3>INCREDIBLE HONEYMOON</h3><p>Convinced that Rackspace was the right choice, Excentus signed a contract and began developing a migration plan to transition the Excentus environment to Rackspace. “We had an incredible honeymoon period,” Melson says as he recalls the early days of his company’s contract with Rackspace. “When we migrated to the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/network/datacenters/">Rackspace data centers</a>, we had zero downtime in terms of program operation. And my team was incredibly impressed that the Rackspace guys were willing to be online with us all night during the cutover.”<br /><br />Today, Excentus has two environments with Rackspace. The secondary facility serves as a backup, as well as a staging environment for new or upgraded applications.<br /><br />Melson is particularly pleased with the quality of Rackspace support. “They show us that they are there for us in a number of ways,” he says. “We get the attention we need, and they even meet with us to do strategic reviews.”<br /><br />When Excentus needs technical support, they count on Rackspace to deliver. “One time we were moving data from one storage array to another, and the Rackspace technician stayed past his shift change to make sure the move got done. It’s that personality of ‘<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support</a>’ that is part of the <a href="http://rackertalent.com/">Rackspace culture</a>.”<br /><br />With Rackspace, Excentus has a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">hosting provider</a> its customers can also trust. “Our customers have confidence that our systems are highly available and compliant,” Melson says. “From a credibility perspective, we can approach a CEO or VP of marketing and tell them, with confidence, that we can deliver on our promises. Our customers feel safe knowing that their applications are running on a Tier 1 hosting provider.”</p>
