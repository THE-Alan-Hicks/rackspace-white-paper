Marketers struggling to grab their attention shouldn&rsquo;t rely on bigger ads or more frequent emails, according to HubSpot CIO Jim O&rsquo;Neill, but rather &ldquo;creating marketing people love.&rdquo;</p><p>HubSpot helps companies do just that through their all-in-one inbound marketing software, which they describe as the only marketing tool their customers need. Those customers agree &mdash;10,000 of them, from SMBs to enterprises, rely on HubSpot&rsquo;s SaaS offering to engage their audiences through smart and personalized content generation, social media monitoring and publishing, lead nurturing, email marketing, and analytics.</p><p>Innovative marketing tools require sophisticated software and high-performance infrastructure. HubSpot has scaled to meet this need by combining a traditional managed environment, a public cloud environment, and &mdash; most recently, for its highest computing demands &mdash; an <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/">OpenStack<sup>&reg;</sup></a>-based <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/">hybrid cloud</a> within Rackspace, boosting their performance and quality of service. This new architecture has proved itself in action &mdash; according to O&rsquo;Neill, &ldquo;We were able to gain four times the efficiency of public cloud for half the cost.&rdquo;</p><h3>An Evolving Relationship</h3><p>A Rackspace customer since 2007, HubSpot initially started with <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/">dedicated hosting</a>. As their platform and customer base grew, they enthusiastically adopted <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public">public cloud</a> technology, shifting to a continuous integration and deployment model that allowed them to deploy production code dozens of times a day. Along with aggressive business growth came new demands for performance and uptime, leading the company to a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/">hybrid solution</a> combining public and private cloud to optimize for the demands of their employees and customers.</p><p>HubSpot became the first user of <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/rackconnect/">RackConnect</a> at Rackspace, a product that integrates dedicated hosting and public cloud resources. They were also among the first to adopt OpenStack-based <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/">Rackspace Private Cloud</a>, which provided the expertise, support model, and the control portions of their application needed without sacrificing the speed and flexibility necessary for their continuous deployment strategy.</p><p>OpenStack also aligned with HubSpot&rsquo;s commitment to the open-source community. The platform represented their first viable chance to embrace an open-source cloud operating system that could handle their future growth and scale, allowing them to extend their usage of open-source technologies below the application layer into their infrastructure and computing layer.</p><h3>A Fully Automated Hybird Cloud Solution</h3><p>HubSpot&rsquo;s deployment strategy allows them to leverage multiple environments, assigning workloads according to mission criticality and performance requirements. It starts with a baseline server image configured to run on either physical or virtual hardware. Deployment automation tools such as Puppet are used to push the cloud operating system and application stack into production. &ldquo;We do not put anything into production unless it is automated,&rdquo; says Craig Tracey, DevOps lead for Hubspot. &ldquo;Automation is critical to everything that we do. We build a lot of our failure-recovery mechanisms into the application itself, and we would not be able to do any of this without APIs.&rdquo;</p><p>The result is an application that is both self-aware and self-reporting, and common APIs such as those provided by OpenStack give HubSpot the ability to deploy on public or private infrastructure with no application rework. This capability allows them to optimize performance by running applications wherever they run most efficiently. &ldquo;Our application literally does not care if it&rsquo;s running on bare metal or in the cloud, whether that be private or public,&rdquo; Tracey says.</p><p>&ldquo;People always look for a price angle on public vs. private. We actually look at it as the SLA that we&rsquo;re offering and the quality of service we&rsquo;re offering,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill explains. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s beautiful about OpenStack is that we can choose among environments and have the right service level and the right quality of service on each of those, based on our understanding of those workloads. For a web hosting platform, which has the most mission-critical uptime and performance, we leverage a fully managed environment. Then there is middleware that bridges those mission-critical front-end apps with our large-scale, backend, big-data apps. Our high throughput, big data, high-performance environment is less about response time and more about scale, so HubSpot tends to fully control that environment, because it&rsquo;s bare metal.&rdquo;</p><h3>Dedicated To Real-Time Analytics</h3><p>HubSpot&rsquo;s analytics engine, powered by <a href="/how-to/getting-started-with-apache-hadoop-on-rackspace-cloud">Apache Hadoop</a>, proved to be well suited to physical hardware, and once again, OpenStack provided a solution for this need. &ldquo;For the analytics engine, we&rsquo;re using the newly released <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Baremetal">OpenStack Bare Metal driver</a>,&rdquo; says Tracey.</p><p>&ldquo;That gives us the flexibility to use the same tools that we use in the cloud to stand up Hadoop instances on physical servers.&rdquo;</p><p>HubSpot&rsquo;s OpenStack implementation manages approximately 150 Hadoop data nodes running on Dell R720 servers configured with 128 GB of RAM and 16 TB of local storage. These specifications allow HubSpot to achieve a lower cost per GB than offered on public infrastructure and analyze billions of data points at near real-time. &ldquo;We can take big data and stream that right into our web applications,&rdquo; explains O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t happen in a high-latency, low-cost commoditized infrastructure. It requires low-latency, medium-cost private infrastructure.&rdquo;</p><p>Private environments also provide HubSpot engineers greater ability to troubleshoot their application when things go wrong. &ldquo;When we look at the private environment, we know what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill says. &ldquo;We have the stethoscope and the visibility to understand the problem, and it really comes down to, &lsquo;Is it a facilities issue, power, network, or application issue?&rsquo; In a public cloud, you&rsquo;re missing those first three; you really only know if it&rsquo;s an application issue or not. We like to think about it as if we have control over the entire stack.&rdquo;</p><h3>Growing with Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup></h3><p>The company has found that Rackspace accommodates their rapid expansion and offers the range of products they needed to continue evolving. &ldquo;As a fast-paced, hypergrowth startup,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill says, &ldquo;Rackspace has always created support programs and teams that met that aggressive growth.&rdquo;</p><p>The Rackspace relationship has also allowed HubSpot to keep their deployment team lean despite continual pressure to keep up with the business&rsquo; growth. Tracey explains, &ldquo;My automation team is about 10 engineers for about 100 application developers, which shows that you can use a small number of engineers to power a large development organization if you&rsquo;re leveraging the cloud. We think of engineers at Rackspace as filling the gaps of the things that we&rsquo;re either incapable of doing or not interested in doing, and there&rsquo;s been a number of scenarios where they&rsquo;ve helped us tremendously.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I truly believe that our <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">support with Rackspace</a> is second-to-none,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill says. &ldquo;Any time I&rsquo;ve ever had an issue, I can pick up the phone, or anyone on our team can pick up the phone and get a Racker within minutes who knows exactly what to do and how to help us. We have not experienced that with anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
