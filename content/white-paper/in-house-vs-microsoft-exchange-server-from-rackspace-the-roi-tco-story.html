<p>First, let’s be forthright: there’s no clear-cut rule that states whether <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/apps/email_hosting/exchange_hosting/">hosting Microsoft Exchange</a> Server® on <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/configurations">dedicated servers</a> or managing email systems in-house is better for your bottom line. Usually a hosted environment is less expensive, but not always. Luckily, there’s a relatively simple way to help you decide what makes sense for your business: figuring out your cost-per-mailbox.</p>

<h3>In-house Hosting—Breaking Down the Price by Mailbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start by determining your annual in-house costs-per-mailbox. The per-mailbox price can vary widely, depending on the specific configuration and the number of mailboxes hosted by the chosen configuration. That being said, according to a <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en/us/a/help/intl/en/admins/pdf/forrester_cloud_email_cost_analysis.pdf" title="Forrester Email Cost Analysis">recent report</a> from a leading technology research company, typical costs run between $16 and $28 per mailbox. Obviously, configurations with more mailboxes usually have a smaller per-mailbox cost.</p>

<p>Every business has their own unique way of managing their email systems, but here are the factors you should consider to get an accurate idea of your cost-per-mailbox:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="rteindent1">Annual hardware costs—servers, firewalls, load balancers, operating systems, data center costs and power</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Depreciation of existing hardware and costs of hardware refreshes</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Financing of servers, storage, software, firewalls and load balancers</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Exchange licenses</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Maintenance and repair costs</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Client software (Outlook) installation and maintenance</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Storage costs—SAN, DAS or NAS</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">ActiveSync or BlackBerry Mobile Messaging—BlackBerry licenses, BlackBerry admin, BES Server, SQL</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Staffing costs—staffing related to the design, deployment, hosting, administration and support of hardware, software, storage and mobile devices</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">End-user administration costs—staffing related user/mailbox administration</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Costs of Microsoft Exchange Server® —Dedicated from Rackspace® Hosting</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hosting a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/dedicated_exchange.php">Dedicated Exchange</a> environment at Rackspace vastly simplifies the factors that determine cost per mailbox. One big thing you’ll notice is that you’re not buying or financing depreciating hardware.</p>

<p>There are choices you can make that will impact your hosted configuration and overall email hosting costs:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="rteindent1">Number of mailboxes you need</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Default mailbox size you would like</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Exchange license provided by you or by us</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Outlook license provided by you or by us</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">BlackBerry licenses and quantities</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Whether or not you need a High Availability (HA) configuration</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Storage preference of DAS or SAN</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Price/performance optimization</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Disaster recovery and backup requirements</li>
	<li class="rteindent1">Anti-virus/Anti-spam services</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you can’t answer all of these questions right now, we can help you figure out an estimated cost-per-mailbox. After a couple conversations with us about hosting your Microsoft Exchange Server® solution with Rackspace, you’ll be surprised at the overall value dedicated hosted email can offer. And, if nothing else, you’ll have the facts to help you make future decisions.</p>
