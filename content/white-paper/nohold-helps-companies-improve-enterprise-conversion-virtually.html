<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> Lower costs; expedite speed and accuracy of diagnostic solutions; restore developer focus on main expertise</p>

<p><strong>RACKSPACE&reg; SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud">Rackspace Managed Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/?cm_mmc=PPCCloudBU-_-Google-_-broad-_-php+host">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers">Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/">Hybrid Hosting</a></p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> noHold has improved scalability, reduced costs, strengthened its ability to develop products, and has greater confidence in the performance of its hosted environment during seasonal demand spikes.</p>

<h3><strong>Optimizing for quality of service and growth with Rackspace Managed Cloud.</strong></h3>

<p>Founded in 1999, noHold makes automated, virtual customer support so natural and effective, it seems like you&rsquo;re interacting with a real person. The Milpitas, California- based company creates virtual assistants to help large enterprise clients in a variety of industries improve customer satisfaction and increase sales.</p>

<p>Focused on helping companies create superior web self-service systems, noHold works with a client roster that includes several Fortune 500 companies. By collecting actionable customer behavior and metrics based on strategic outcomes, companies who work with noHold and its EZintel technology can analyze measurable customer input and intelligence, promoting offerings accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been Rackspace customers for over ten years, and it has been a great experience,&rdquo; explains Dario DeSantis, Product &amp; Engineering Manager for noHold. &ldquo;Rackspace has added enormous value by helping us understand the flexibility and resources we need to accommodate growth, and to offer the best possible quality of service within budgetary constraints.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Activating the Rackspace Solution</strong></p>

<p>noHold works with each client to assign specific customer needs and then custom design a virtual assistant used as the front line for the consumer interaction. &ldquo;These Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based expert systems are based on support knowledge that our customers provide,&rdquo; said DeSantis. &ldquo;[The systems] look a bit like web chat, but instead of chatting with a human being, you are chatting with an artificial intelligence agent which is able to answer your questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The highly interactive and diagnostic noHold solution enables phone users to avoid having to go on hold during the call. &ldquo;Because the AI agent answers your question, you don&rsquo;t need to escalate to a live agent. We are able to bring them to the right solution on the basis of natural language interaction,&rdquo; said DeSantis. &ldquo;This is even more powerful, because normal search implies customers know in advance the right keywords. Most of the time, however, customers have problems they do not know how to articulate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Efficiency Affords noHold Focus and Delivery</strong></p>

<p>During the noHold engineering process, when an application is compatible with customer needs, it is implemented and then passes through quality assurance and beta testing&mdash;with noHold professional services thoroughly testing every single portal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is all deployed on production, and production means Rackspace,&rdquo; said DeSantis. &ldquo;We are hosted in a hybrid cloud where our front-end lies on the public segment, and we have a private segment where our clients&rsquo; databases are hosted. Our Rackspace engineers interact whenever any of our requirements are changing for various business reasons, or because of seasonality and demand increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>noHold offers a &lsquo;knowledge management for web-customer&rsquo; platform, headed by interacting virtual agents which gather information from users. Data generated from those interactions then become the basis for customer insight. Interactions are therefore more efficient, and calls contain more direct ROI.</p>

<p><strong>Powering noHold&rsquo;s Future</strong></p>

<p>According to DeSantis, when you deal with big global companies who require security and data integrity, you must be able to provide the same high level of confidence those companies expect. Rackspace provides the technology and the confidence to offer those securities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clients get a predictable expectation of what the interaction will be, and it&rsquo;s going to be fast. They just write a few keywords about their problem, and they get the result immediately. Or if it&rsquo;s more complicated, then the system is able to determine the need for information, and drive the interaction with users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With fast growth&mdash;and with Rackspace as an extension of the team&mdash;noHold can evolve its data center rapidly, staying focused on priority work rather than getting bogged down on IT-related issues. &ldquo;What makes the difference..., and probably why we chose Rackspace rather than another competitor, is the human dimension,&rdquo; said DeSantis.</p>
