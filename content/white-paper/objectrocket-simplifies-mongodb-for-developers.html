Co-founders Chris Lalonde, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_necZ_HG5g">Kenny Gorman</a>, and Erik Beebe recognized this problem and created ObjectRocket to provide an easy-to-use, developer-friendly database as a service based on the MongoDB platform. ObjectRocket takes MongoDB far beyond simple hosting by offering a highly tuned, purpose-built platform with automation and support services to provide customers with a cost effective yet incredibly scalable database solution.</p><h3>Getting The Right Hardware</h3><p>In order to offer the highest performance and availability possible, ObjectRocket chose <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/dedicated_servers/">dedicated hardware</a>. The generic servers public cloud is built on are designed to be suitable for a variety of uses, but services with advanced requirements can benefit from more specialized hardware.</p><p>Lalonde explains, “Databases have very specific needs around CPU, memory, and storage I/O. In most enterprises, you would never think about taking a front-end web server, throwing Oracle on it, and then saying, ‘Yep, that’s okay, we’ll use that as a database.’ When you’re using the public cloud, you’re getting a system designed to handle typical application server workloads — and that’s what it works well for. To run a reliable, highly performant database, you need a stack that’s designed from the ground up with that workload in mind.”</p><p>“We have built our platform from the ground up,” says Lalonde. “We got our own data centers when we started, we racked computers, we specifically purpose-built those computers, we tweaked the operating system, we tweaked the network interfaces, we built all that stuff up to make a system that will scale with you from a very small instance all the way up to petabytes of storage.”</p><p>ObjectRocket also distinguishes itself by relying entirely upon solid-state storage, a move that has allowed it to provide incredible speed. Co-founder Kenny Gorman explains, “The disk subsystem is state of the art. Our systems are state of the art. We scale easily, so if folks need to scale they can click a button and add new shards — the MongoDB term for scaling horizontally.”</p><h3>Customer Successes</h3><p>The scalability and support that ObjectRocket offers has allowed them to stick with one customer through a major acquisition. “We had a customer who started off on a very small footprint with us, a mobile gaming company,” says Lalonde. “They used a small instance, 5GB, because it’s a mobile game and they didn’t know whether the game was going to be a hit or not. Scaling was really important to them, performance was important to them, all of those key things. The developers often needed help tuning and tweaking some of the game requests back into the database, so it sort of hit all of the buttons for us.”</p><p>“When that mobile company was acquired by a larger mobile company,” Lalonde continues, “the larger company saw what the little one was doing in terms of price, performance, support, and said, ‘Let’s try that.’ Over the last three months, they’ve moved three of their largest games onto our platform and had a lot of success doing it. They’re paying less in raw dollars, they’re getting better support, better performance, and now they’ve been acquired by an even larger gaming company, so we’re looking at that again.”</p><h3>A Cultural Match</h3><p>Service is just as important to ObjectRocket as scalability and performance. “We’re not just MongoDB in the cloud — we want to be your DBA, your ops guy,” Lalonde says. “We want to provide the next level of support. We’ll help you pick shard keys, we’ll come and look through your data for you if you want us to, we’ll come and help you tune queries. We’ll do all of these things for you.”</p><p>Though the startup was initially built in two Equinix data centers, meeting with Rackspace during their Series A round convinced them they’d met their hosting match. “We hit it off completely,” says Lalonde. “Rackspace has the same guiding ideals that we have around <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support<sup>®</sup></a>, wanting to deliver the best product to the customer, and providing a very unique, highly available, highly performant service for the customer. Because of that connection between us and Rackspace, we got to talking. The rest, as they say, is history.”</p><p><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/objectrocket-acquisition-faq/">ObjectRocket was acquired by Rackspace in February 2013</a>, which Lalonde sees as a mutually beneficial arrangement. “We get the power of Rackspace. Expanding our global footprint, leveraging business solutions — we wouldn’t be able to do that without Rackspace. And what Rackspace customers are getting from ObjectRocket is the ability to run MongoDB on a world-class platform, highly scalable, highly performant, highly available, and best-of-breed service. It’s something that customers are really looking for, we’ve really felt the demand for already, and we’re going to bring it to them.”</p><p>“We’ve had phenomenal growth over the last two quarters,” he says. “It’s been fantastic for us. Being part of Rackspace is just an amazing thing.”</p><p>Learn more about <a href="/how-to/objectrocket-documentation">ObjectRocket at Rackspace. </a></p>
