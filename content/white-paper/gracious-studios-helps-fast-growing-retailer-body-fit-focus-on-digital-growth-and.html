<p><strong>CUSTOMER’S BUSINESS: </strong>One of Holland’s largest full-service digital agencies, hosting numerous ecommerce sites, including Body &amp; Fit, Benelux’s leading ecommerce retailer for sport nutrition and dietary supplements.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>Designing and implementing a reliable, scalable platform that supports their rapidly growing base of ecommerce sites.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/">Rackspace Hybrid Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/">Cloud Servers with Managed Service Level</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/?cm_mmc=PPCCA-_-Google-_-broad-_-online+storage+cloud">Cloud Files</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/">Cloud Load Balancers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>The agency is noticing improvement in customer service related to the reliability of the site. Body &amp; Fit has grown by 70 percent in the past year. They have also seen website speed improvement since moving Rackspace.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace helps ensure websites offer first-class online shopping experience. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Speed and Site Performance Matter with Digital</strong></p>
<p>When Gracious Studios wanted to help customer Body &amp; Fit, Benelux’s market leader in sport nutrition, build a reliable, scalable and secure ecommerce platform, they called Rackspace. To help improve performance, the digital agency is experimenting with Facebook’s HIPHOP for PHP (HHVM).</p>
<p>In the digital world, site performance is a key factor in customer retention. As companies commit to online environments in a highly competitive marketplace, a slow-loading site could send impatient consumers elsewhere, meaning potential loss of revenue and damage to the company’s brand.</p>
<p>Gracious Studios has been a Rackspace customer since mid-2013. Since opening in 2007, this leading Dutch enterprise and SMB provider has worked with the likes of bol.com, one of the largest ecommerce platforms in the Netherlands, as well as German etailer neckermann.com.</p>
<p>Body &amp; Fit serves approximately 3,000 people daily. To deliver the consistent, highly responsive end-user experience that is essential for a digital retailer,&nbsp;Body &amp; Fit asked Gracious Studios to help design a more reliable architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Fast &amp; Secure: The Rackspace Hybrid Cloud Delivers</strong></p>
<p>Working with Body &amp; Fit’s stated priorities of maximum availability and Gracious Studios’ goal of seamless integration into its environment; Gracious Studios and Rackspace worked jointly to design and execute a best-fit solution that would help ensure optimal Body &amp; Fit online store performance.</p>
<p>Gracious Studios rebuilt the Body &amp; Fit site from the ground up in Magento. Using a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/" target="_self">Rackspace Hybrid Cloud</a> architecture consisting of two dedicated database servers connected to multiple cloud Web servers, Gracious Studios has been able&nbsp;to provide the customer’s ecommerce site with improved security, scalability and availability. The hybrid infrastructure allows for growth in the Body &amp; Fit database, with Gracious Studios electing to spin up new servers as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency For All: A More Reliable Customer Experience</strong></p>
<p>The highly collaborative hybrid architecture is paying dividends for both Gracious Studios and its high-profile customer.</p>
<p>Body &amp; Fit can enjoy a better performing site, leading to increases in customer satisfaction, loyalty and strengthened brand reputation. Powered by Rackspace, the Body &amp; Fit site has improved flexibility, security and performance. Since launching its ecommerce site with Gracious Studios, Body &amp; Fit is no longer experiencing significant interruption of service or downtime.</p>
<p>By hosting with Rackspace, Gracious Studios decreases costs, raises operational efficiency, and potentially increases its revenue among all customers. In addition, Gracious Studios can monitor and test the performance of different stages of all its internal development work.</p>
<p>“With Rackspace, our time to market is faster. We pay by the hour, and only for the bandwidth we use, which has cut our costs roughly in half,” says Suraj Sanchit, Creative Director, Gracious Studios. “So far, Rackspace has answered all our questions. They’ve even taken over some of the installation and configuration of the web servers, and haven’t charged extra.”</p>
