<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Apache&trade; Hadoop&reg; open-source software framework allows for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers. Using simple programming models, Hadoop enables companies to derive business value from large volumes of unstructured, aggregated data. This opens up a wide range of cutting-edge use cases, such as fraud detection and social-media sentiment analysis. However, Hadoop is notoriously difficult to deploy and requires expensive, hard-to-find expertise.</p>

<p>The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform is an enterprise-ready service based on the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for Hadoop. The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform offers the powerful benefits of big-data analysis without the challenges of configuring clusters, maintaining the platform, or troubleshooting jobs.</p>

<h2>The challenges of managing Hadoop</h2>

<p>The ability of Hadoop to efficiently store and process large, diverse data sets is attractive to business leaders trying to make informed, data-driven decisions. Companies that attempt to deploy Hadoop on their own, however, face several daunting challenges.</p>

<h3>Updates create vicious cycle</h3>

<p>Hadoop is unusual. As a distributed system, it requires extensive management and offers no centralized storage. Experienced architecture experts are hard to find, and their expertise is short-lived because the technology evolves so fast each point release adds new tools and brings notable changes to the architecture. Together, these complexities create a cycle of chronic challenges. Even if businesses can find experts, they may reach the end of a months-long procurement process only to discover that the architecture of Hadoop has already changed. That sends architects back to the drawing board and leaves companies far behind schedule.</p>

<h3>Hadoop security is limited</h3>

<p>Enterprise deployments of Hadoop have long been hampered by the lack of default security solutions and the difficulty of maintaining affordable, compliance-grade protections. Open-source projects have helped improve the out-of-the-box security of Hadoop, but businesses still need to add layers of protection to adequately monitor and safeguard valuable customer data.</p>

<h3>Capital and operating costs can be prohibitive</h3>

<p> Implementing and managing a big-data solution based on Hadoop can be extremely expensive. The hardware required to meet big data demands is a major investment for enterprises that do not have access to large volumes of commodity machines. And then there are the often-overlooked operational costs of Hadoop. Leveraging Hadoop frequently requires businesses to re-train existing staff and hire new employees to monitor and maintain the system.</p>

<h3>Non-optimized hardware causes delays</h3>

<p>Running Hadoop on non-optimized hardware can yield slower queries, leaving end users with sluggish visibility into the data that they need to make better decisions and build profitable solutions. As Hadoop evolves to address new streaming and interactive workloads, query performance variations of even a couple of seconds will make or break the end-user experience.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<a id="hadoop"> </a>

<h2>Managed Hadoop</h2>

<p>The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform can greatly simplify the process of implementing, optimizing, and maintaining Hadoop, which allows customers to fully focus on deriving insights from their data; IT resources can be reallocated to initiatives that differentiate the business and build a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Rackspace handles management throughout the Hadoop life cycle of design, configuration, deployment and maintenance, so internal teams don’t have to. Rackspace works directly with Hortonworks, so customers have a single point of contact. Experts from both companies maintain single-pane visibility into the infrastructure and platform/application layers, sparing customers the multi-vendor complexity that often arises when infrastructure and platform providers interact. This helps customers get the answers they need in less time. Customers get the combination of infrastructure expertise and Hadoop application expertise that is critical to maintaining a healthy environment.</p>

<p>Rackspace stands behind every part of the service with Fanatical Support. Rackspace support staff and engineers are available 24x7x365 for everything from architecture design to query optimization.</p>

<h2>Use cases</h2>

<p>The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform uses the popular Hortonworks Data Platform to help businesses address a variety of common use cases, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Financial analysis<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Clickstream analysis<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Healthcare record retention and processing<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Social media data and sentiment analysis<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3>Financial analysis</h3>

<p>In the financial industry, controlling risk is paramount, and the only way to control risk is to understand it. Hadoop offers diverse options for obtaining deep, data-driven insights and using them to quickly evaluate potential risks, including the risk of fraud.</p>

<p>The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform offers single-tenant isolation so that customers can address security needs for their financial data.</p>

<h3>Clickstream analysis</h3>

<p>Keeping customers on a website requires understanding their motivations. Using Hadoop, businesses can efficiently store and process enormous volumes of clickstream data&mdash;information about how users view, scroll over, and click through web pages. This can give them the opportunity to analyze, visualize, and understand how their visitors are behaving on their websites. Companies can also use clickstream data to instantly respond to customer behavior, offering users special deals or strategically re-targeting them. Forward-thinking retailers have made a business practice out of this use case, and are more effectively managing their ecommerce sites and online catalogs.</p>

<p>The Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform simplifies the deployment and maintenance of Hadoop, allowing marketers to speed up customer intelligence initiatives without overburdening IT departments. Traditionally, marketing organizations haven’t budgeted for infrastructure or IT, so it is important to choose a platform that restrains costs.</p>

<h3>Healthcare record retention and processing</h3>

<p>Many healthcare organizations store large volumes of data for extended periods of time, and they also need to meet stringent security standards to protect patient privacy.</p>

<p>Hadoop is an inherently distributed system that can allow healthcare IT teams to store data far more affordably than they could with relational data-warehouse systems. And they will gain access to shared compute, enabling them to run analytics and ad hoc queries on patient data. When doctors are guided by data-driven insights and have instant access to health records, they can make better-informed decisions faster.</p>

<p>With Rackspace Managed Big Data Platform, Rackspace and Hortonworks experts facilitate the normally difficult process of deploying Hadoop. Moreover, Rackspace offers a number of security solutions that healthcare companies can choose from to help them meet their compliance needs.</p>

<h3>Social media data and sentiment analysis</h3>

<p>With Hadoop, businesses can quickly mine, archive, and analyze many thousands of social media conversations for sentiment data&mdash;the ratio of positive comments to negative comments&mdash;for example. Companies can assess customers’ attitudes about their products, services, brand, and competitors. They can then track those opinions over time.</p>

<p>From gathering data on social media platforms after a product launch to tracking a decline in customer engagement on social media posts, Hadoop enables businesses to leverage this kind of data in a number of ways to make targeted, real-time decisions.</p>

<p>Businesses can Hadoop makes it possible to manage and exploit big data, whether that means streaming social media feeds, or querying, refining, and visualizing the information they contain. With Rackspace Managed Big Data, you don’t need Hadoop experts, and social analytics projects like these will become much more feasible for both IT and marketing. For teams with limited Hadoop experience, Rackspace experts are always ready to help users leverage Flume to stream Twitter feeds into HDFS, HCatalog to build a relational view of the data, or Hive to query and refine it.</p>
