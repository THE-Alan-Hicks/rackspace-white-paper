<p><strong>RACKSPACE® SOLUTION:  </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/" target="_blank">Rackspace Private Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/services/security/firewalls/" target="_blank">Dedicated Firewalls</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing/" target="_blank">Load Balancers</a></p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong> Deliver speed, scale and flexibility to address peak workloads and planned site growth.</p>

<h3> <strong>Rackspace provides the right platform and solutions to scale growth.</strong></h3>

<p>The rapid rise of Kendra Scott Design began with only $500. In 2002, Kendra Scott started her jewelry business in Austin, Texas with a modest investment to create jewelry from a spare bedroom. In high-growth mode since 2010, the company has been significantly expanding its wholesale, retail and online businesses.</p>

<p>Since inception, Kendra Scott Design has risen to become a worldwide multi-million dollar brand, with Scott’s designs sold through its 17 retail stores, via its ecommerce site <a href="http://www.kendrascott.com/">kendrascott.com</a>, at more than 700 boutiques and at retailers such as Bloomingdale’s, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom.</p>

<p>In 2009, the company employed eight people. Today, it staffs 165, with plans to hire another 150 as it opens additional stores across the U.S. next year. The brand could not be hotter, with the jewelry featured among some of Hollywood’s A-List stars, in movies, and on TV. A recently added line of travel bags sold well, and Kendra Scott intends to introduce new product lines.</p>

<p>“We are doubling our web business each year and we’re getting ready to grow even more,” said Tria Foster, Vice President of Ecommerce &amp; Loyalty for Kendra Scott Design. “We’ve increased our sales since last year by about 220 percent. For the web business, that’s phenomenal traffic growth. We have a very engaged customer base on our website, so we take the time to make sure we’re focusing on the performance and scalability.”</p>

<p><strong>The Kendra Scott Solution - Powered by Rackspace</strong></p>

<p>To address Kendra Scott Design’s unique needs, Rackspace designed a powerful, automated <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/">Magento solution</a> for deploying <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private">Rackspace Private Cloud</a> on bare metal. Using this deployment system, Kendra Scott can leverage the capability to burst into the cloud for peak periods, and only when necessary. Additionally, Kendra Scott hosts its development, staging and production servers at Rackspace.</p>

<p>“We really like the ability to expand into the cloud for peak periods,” said Foster. “Together with our Rackspace and Magento technical teams, we were able to design a solution that allowed us to move to the bare metal with cloud burst solution, and we are working closely with them to ensure we have a solid plan for growth over the next few years.”</p>

<p>Each Halloween, kendrascott.com offers a highly popular promotion during which visitors browse numerous images to locate promo codes hidden throughout the site. “When we first ran the promotion, our customers were on the site an average of 28 pageviews, and we had problems with the site. Fast-forward a year with Rackspace aboard, and we are expecting everything to be just fine for this year’s promotion.”</p>

<p>“From development all the way through to production, we have very similar environments. We have great day-by-day analytics and can anticipate what our growth is going to be for critical peak times. We’re doing performance testing well in advance, so that we can understand precisely where we are, and where we need to be based on our projections.</p>

<p>“We have a great social media team and our blog drives a ton of traffic also, along with ad campaigns and marketing,” said Foster.</p>

<p>“As we continue to leverage what’s working and layer that on top of the fact that now we’re opening new stores, the traffic is growing unbelievably and we’re keeping our technical teams busy.”</p>

<p><strong>Consistent Performance Provides a “WOW” Customer Service Experience</strong></p>

<p>Kendra Scott sees similarities between Rackspace <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ge7rotzBI0">Fanatical Support®</a><strong> </strong>and its own proprietary customer service approach, referred to as “WOW” Customer Service.</p>

<p>“Rackspace already knows who we are, they know exactly what systems we’re using, they know exactly what platform they’re on. If there is an issue, I know for a fact that I’m going to get it resolved, and somebody’s going to stick with me until I do. If there’s an issue, they’re on it, typically before my development team has to get involved.</p>

<p>“Considering our growth, ensuring that our infrastructure can support that growth is extremely important. Having the ability to reach a solid technical resource that is available 24x7 and truly cares about getting to a solid solution allows us to control our uptime much tighter. In the end, it’s about uptime and performance. We’ve been very happy with our overall experience.”</p>
