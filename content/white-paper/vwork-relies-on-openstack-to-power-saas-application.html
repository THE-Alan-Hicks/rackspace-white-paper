A SaaS application,&nbsp;vWork provides job scheduling and dispatch&nbsp;for companies with mobile field workers.</p><p>Jonathan Hoskin, Infrastructure Architect&nbsp;at vWork explains, &ldquo;vWork is best suited&nbsp;to businesses with 10 to 100 employees&nbsp;in industries which require the regular&nbsp;scheduling and dispatching of workers. We&nbsp;serve hundreds of customers in a variety of&nbsp;industries, in about 50 countries.&rdquo;</p><h3><strong>ELIMINATING IT OVERHEAD</strong></h3><p>Before moving to Rackspace, vWork&nbsp;hosted server clusters, in a both a third party&nbsp;data center (for their production&nbsp;environment), as well as in their own data&nbsp;center (for development). &ldquo;At peak, we had&nbsp;15 to 20 servers, plus the entire supporting&nbsp;infrastructure that was required,&rdquo; says Hoskin.</p><p>But doing business with local hosting&nbsp;providers in New Zealand also came with&nbsp;a steep pricetag. vWork soon found it was&nbsp;having to manage the SaaS stack, and the&nbsp;hardware underneath it, and it was also&nbsp;faced with the capital purchase of upgrades,&nbsp;new equipment, and maintenance.</p><p>The company began evaluating hosting&nbsp;providers based on their ability to scale&nbsp;and support emerging vWorks needs. &ldquo;We&nbsp;were searching for a reasonable way to&nbsp;control costs, eliminate expense involving&nbsp;physical servers, and outsource all the&nbsp;distractions,&rdquo; said Hoskin. &ldquo;Rackspace understood our requirements. We were able&nbsp;to migrate without having to change many&nbsp;of our existing processes or platforms. And&nbsp;Rackspace provided outstanding support&nbsp;throughout the move.&rdquo;</p><h3><strong>IMPROVED PERFORMANCE WITH OPENSTACK</strong></h3><p>Now operating on Linux OS and the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/openstack_software/">OpenStack platform</a>, vWork&nbsp;has observed significant upticks in performance. &ldquo;We have seen&nbsp;increased uptime vs. public cloud, and we have simplified options&nbsp;for scale-out and scale-up on OpenStack,&rdquo; says Hoskin. &ldquo;And our&nbsp;developers enjoy more optimally matched automation in our self-service&nbsp;environments.&rdquo;</p><p>With the move to Rackspace, vWork has achieved its goal of&nbsp;reducing complexity and cost in its IT operations and infrastructure.&nbsp;This allows Hoskin and his development team to remain nimble in a&nbsp;fast-growing vertical.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I am regularly amazed at how responsive and capable the&nbsp;Rackspace staff is. When we require an infrastructure change&nbsp;at Rackspace, we can get it almost immediately. Our small&nbsp;development team is only viable if we can remain agile, so having&nbsp;infrastructure that behaves the same way is crucial. We&rsquo;re predicting&nbsp;massive growth this year, so we will be relying on Rackspace to&nbsp;rapidly expand our infrastructure as required.&rdquo;</p>
