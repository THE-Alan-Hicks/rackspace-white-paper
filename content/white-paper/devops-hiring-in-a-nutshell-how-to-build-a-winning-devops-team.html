<p><strong>DEVOPS: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>

<p>In many ways, software development has come full circle. During the mainframe and client-server eras of IT&mdash;from the 1950s through the 1990s&mdash;programmers needed a working understanding of infrastructure. In order to start coding, they likely needed to set up a server and database first. But as the waterfall method of software development became the norm, roles separated. Development and operations functions became much more specialized. Programmers didn&rsquo;t concern themselves with infrastructure, and system administrators didn&rsquo;t need to know programming. When the code was finished, the developer tossed it over the wall to the operations and QA teams for deployment. Feedback trickled in slowly and was addressed in the next release, sometimes months or years down the line.</p>

<p>In a world where software shipped on a CD once a year, the waterfall method of development worked fine. The silos between development and operations teams were perhaps never ideal, but they didn&rsquo;t render the process unworkable, either.</p>

<p>With the rise of the internet and cloud computing, some companies began to recognize that new ways of working offered certain competitive advantages.</p>

<p><img height="151" src="https://admin.rackspace.comhttps://8026b2e3760e2433679c-fffceaebb8c6ee053c935e8915a3fbe7.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/DevOpsHiring-1.png" width="552" /></p>

<p>In order to meet the demands of true web-scale computing, some businesses began to adopt the Agile development methodology, shifting the way they build and ship code. Rapid deployment and continuous integration became the standard. It was no longer enough for businesses to merely release a better product in order to stay competitive&mdash; they also needed to build and ship it faster than everyone else.</p>

<p>To accomplish the goal of rapid, continuous deployment, some organizations began to optimize their development methods. They tore down the wall between development and operations. Rather than working in silos, developers and operations teams collaborated and aligned their efforts toward common business goals.</p>

<p>They discovered that infrastructure needed to be automated in order to keep up. Under this faster method of development, code had to be pushed from development to testing to staging and finally to the live production environment as quickly as possible. When code breaks, it is usually because one of these environments doesn&rsquo;t look like the others. It&rsquo;s an easy fix when you only have 10 servers. But when you&rsquo;re dealing with multiple redundancies across global data centers&mdash;possibly thousands of temporary instances&mdash;you need to manage your infrastructure en masse. Many organizations found that configuration management tools like Chef and Puppet provided the quickest and most effective way to configure their environments identically.</p>

<p>The practice of incorporating these new cultural, organizational and technological ways of working has come to be known as DevOps.</p>

<p>This new way of working requires a different kind of skill set.</p>

<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING THE DEVOPS SKILL SET</strong></p>

<p>There is a fierce debate within the DevOps community as to what the ideal DevOps professional looks like.</p>

<p>Early on, Facebook<sup>&reg;</sup> famously championed the hiring of full-stack programmers<sup>1</sup>&mdash; generalists with an understanding of both programming and infrastructure. They pushed their developers to be aware of their code&rsquo;s production and architecture dependencies every step of the way, and to solve infrastructure problems using code.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a contingent of DevOps practitioners who take issue with this approach, arguing instead that there really is no such thing as a full-stack programmer. Their concept of DevOps doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the complete absence of &ldquo;Ops&rdquo;&mdash;it just means that software engineers and system administrators work more closely together, as specialists in their practice areas rather than cross-team generalists.</p>

<p>Which side is employing the right approach to DevOps&mdash;the generalists or the specialists? The answer is both. DevOps, in practice, means different things to different organizations. And factors such as the number of team members, company size and goals should influence the kind of engineers businesses hire to fill these roles.</p>

<p><em>To learn more about the different ways companies are putting DevOps into practice, read our white paper, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/devops/the-devops-mindset">The DevOps Mindset: Real-World Insights From Tech Leaders</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Early Stage Companies</strong></p>

<p>While the cloud accelerated the adoption of DevOps practices across the industry, the growth of DevOps was also spurred by the boom in startups. There is a reason that companies like Facebook and Flickr were at the forefront of the DevOps movement&mdash;they started small and grew rapidly. In smaller startups with limited resources, developers are often forced to wear multiple hats&mdash;from programming to running the company&rsquo;s cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>For these types of companies, engineers who understand the entire stack are essential. The size, speed and collaborative nature of the startup model gives it a competitive advantage over larger organizations. It breeds a culture where failing fast and deploying often is seen as a virtue.</p>

<p><strong>Mature Companies</strong></p>

<p>As a company grows, however, roles inevitably shift. Facebook may have been able to rely on everyone doing everything early on, but the challenges and complexities of running a DevOps team at Facebook circa 2009 are very different from those faced by Facebook in 2014.</p>

<p>When a company begins to grow, it&rsquo;s no longer feasible to expect developers to do everything&mdash;getting products to market, responding to customer needs and managing infrastructure at scale using code. Technical roles at these larger organizations naturally become more specialized, with programmers, dedicated QA specialists and even staff focused exclusively on configuration management tools.</p>

<p>This means that DevOps at a mature company will look different than at a startup, though the underlying principles are the same. &ldquo;Specialized&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean going back to the waterfall method; the DevOps ethos is still ingrained in every task.</p>

<p>Regardless of company size, it&rsquo;s critical that everyone on the team shares some understanding of how the entire system works, and that both development and operations are clear on the business goals they are driving toward. Once a business determines how they want to implement DevOps, they need to begin the challenging process of finding the right candidates.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TO LOOK FOR ON A DEVOPS RESUME</strong></p>

<p>First, these kinds of candidates may not actually be called &ldquo;DevOps engineers.&rdquo; According to a Puppet Labs survey<sup>2</sup>, only 18 percent of IT professionals say that there is someone in their organization that has this title.</p>

<p>Some in the DevOps community are reporting a kind of backlash against the term, which has become something of a buzzword in the industry. <a href="http://www.adamrabinovitch.co.uk/">Adam Rabinovitch</a>, a London-based recruiter who hires for DevOps teams, says that he doesn&rsquo;t scan resumes for the term &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; anymore because it&rsquo;s become ubiquitous. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather look for someone with coding skills but who has a history of utilizing the deployment tools that the business is using,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go back to your standard software engineer that&rsquo;s been using the right tools instead of looking for the word &lsquo;DevOps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>If scanning for the word &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work, how do you surface qualified candidates from a pile of resumes? Here are a few key considerations:</p>

<p><strong>The Job Title</strong></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in a name? It turns out not much. The types of professionals that tend to thrive on a DevOps team may go by a number of different titles&mdash;Systems Engineer, Network or System Administrator, Software Engineer or Full-Stack Developer. More important than the job title, however, is the professional experience that supports it.</p>

<p><strong>The Non-traditional Career Path</strong></p>

<p>Qualified DevOps engineers tend to be polymaths with non-traditional career paths. Instead of rising from Developer to Sr. Developer, the candidate may be a programmer who has taken a detour somewhere in their career and become interested in infrastructure. Or it may be a System Administrator who has a GitHub account packed with sideline code projects.</p>

<p>And while professional experience counts for a lot, don&rsquo;t discount candidates who may wear one hat by day and another in their free time. The most passionate candidates will often be the ones who have led personal projects that illustrate a deep knowledge of both development and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Think about IT skills as a spectrum, with traditional development on one side and traditional operations roles on the other. The best DevOps candidates fall somewhere near the middle. The precise combination of coding and infrastructure skills you should seek will depend on the specific role and functions for which you are hiring. But one thing is certain&mdash;the ideal candidate will have some experience with both coding and infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>The Experience With Infrastructure Automation Tools</strong></p>

<p>On top of fluency in web languages such as Ruby, Python, PHP or Java, the ideal DevOps engineer should have some experience using infrastructure automation tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack or Windows PowerShell DSC. These tools are at the heart of every successful DevOps team, so experience using them to deploy code should elevate candidates to the top of the resume pile.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a catch: This kind of expertise is scarce, and finding experienced candidates presents a challenge for hiring managers. According to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/author/prashanthchandrasekar/">Prashanth Chandrasekar</a>, General Manager of the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/devops">Rackspace<sup>&reg;</sup> DevOps</a> business segment, &ldquo;Many of these DevOps tools are relatively new and are evolving at a rapid pace through the open source community. Every day new tools that perform very specific functions (very efficiently) in the automation tool chain are emerging. It&rsquo;s very hard to find a fully skilled professional in the market who has achieved a competent level of expertise on all these rapidly evolving tools. Learning Chef is not an overnight task. You have to invest a material amount of time to really use it effectively to treat your infrastructure like code.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are myriad configuration management tools to choose from, and each demands its own specific skill set. It&rsquo;s important that the tools your team implements and the people you&rsquo;ve hired to automate your infrastructure are aligned. &ldquo;Chef, for example, was made with a developer bias,&rdquo; Chandrasekar says. &ldquo;Whereas a tool like Ansible was written for system administrators in a lot of ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Soft Skills: Hiring A Collaborative Communicator</strong></p>

<p>Because DevOps is a cultural approach and not just a set of automation tools, organizations should think about the interpersonal skills that make DevOps practitioners successful. Cross-team communication and collaboration strategies may be harder to screen for than technical competencies, but they&rsquo;re no less important.</p>

<p>Rabinovitch finds it useful to ask project-based questions, such as &ldquo;What was your greatest achievement on a recent project? What were your goals? What did you achieve and what were the outcomes? What problems did you face and how did you solve them in a way that met the team&rsquo;s goals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a DevOps recruiter for Rackspace, Nate Frickel has found that the soft skills are often as important as the hard technical qualifications. &ldquo;In the conversations I have with candidates, I&rsquo;m listening for the kinds of comments they are making about their current situation. Are they the kind of person who is looking for a solution, or are they just complaining about the other side?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Start-Up Mentality</strong></p>

<p>Enterprises have historically worked in silos. As a result, they&rsquo;ve earned a reputation for moving slowly when it comes to innovation. That&rsquo;s one reason why DevOps teams tend to favor engineers with start-up backgrounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spoke to one of my corporate clients,&rdquo; Rabinovitch says. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want someone who comes from a corporate background&mdash;not unless they want to work with a start-up mentality.&rdquo; Engineers with a history of success on collaborative, fast- paced teams that continuously deploy code will have the upper hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real &lsquo;wow&rsquo; factor,&rdquo; according to Chandrasekar, &ldquo;is if they have worked for a startup where they helped push code into production at a rapid pace. If they were doing that as part of a small team, then we know that they had a big impact.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>WHERE ARE ALL THE BEST CANDIDATES HIDING?</strong></p>

<p><img height="224" src="https://admin.rackspace.comhttps://8026b2e3760e2433679c-fffceaebb8c6ee053c935e8915a3fbe7.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/DevOpsHiring-2.png" width="555" /></p>

<p>With demand far outstripping the supply of qualified candidates, the biggest challenge hiring managers and recruiters face is finding the right person. While picking a great candidate from the resume pile presents a challenge, often the best candidates are the ones that didn&rsquo;t submit an application. To locate these candidates, businesses need a proactive hiring strategy.</p>

<p>LinkedIn&reg;, the world&rsquo;s largest professional networking site, is still a great source for finding would-be candidates, but it falls short in a few respects.</p>

<p>While LinkedIn gives you a glimpse into a candidate&rsquo;s work history, it doesn&rsquo;t showcase their actual work, or give you a picture of their engagement with the growing DevOps community. In the last few years, there have been a slew of articles highlighting another predicament: engineers are being overwhelmed with messages from recruiters on LinkedIn. It&rsquo;s a good problem to have if you&rsquo;re a developer, but if you&rsquo;re trying to build a DevOps team it can be frustrating.</p>

<p>As a result, recruiters are looking outside of traditional hiring methods to source the best candidates. Here are some outside-the-box places they are finding them:</p>

<p><strong>GITHUB &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></strong></p>

<p>Companies are beginning to recognize that poring through GitHub repositories is a great way to find developers who are demonstrating their skills through open-source and private projects.</p>

<p><strong>STACK EXCHANGE / STACK OVERFLOW &ndash; <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">http://stackexchange.com/</a> </strong></p>

<p>Skilled developers can share their software expertise through Q&amp;A and discussions. It can be a good way to assess how engaged candidates are with the larger community. Stack Exchange also has a job board, which targets these kinds of candidates where they live.</p>

<p><strong>BLOGGERS</strong></p>

<p>The enthusiasm surrounding DevOps elevates it to more than just a practice. To those involved, it&rsquo;s a true movement. The best, most experienced engineers are often those speaking the loudest. Blogging has become a platform for skilled developers to demonstrate and share their expertise.</p>

<p><strong>DEVOPS ZONE &ndash; <a href="http://dzone.com/mz/devops/">http://dzone.com/mz/devops/</a> </strong></p>

<p>DevOps Zone is kind of like Reddit for all-things DevOps&mdash;a forum where anyone interested in DevOps can post articles and have discussions about DevOps best practices. The developers participating in these discussions and sharing their expertise will likely be among your most engaged and qualified candidates.</p>

<p><strong>TWITTER<sup>&reg;</sup> &ndash; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">http://www.twitter.com/</a> </strong></p>

<p>You can tell a lot about a candidate in 140 characters. Twitter&rsquo;s search tool makes it easy to find people who are driving the conversation around DevOps. When reaching out to these candidates, remember that Twitter is a platform that values genuine and personal engagement. A cold-call message about a job opportunity may be perceived as spam unless it&rsquo;s preceded by some kind of authentic interaction.</p>

<p><strong>CONFERENCES &ndash; <a href="http://devopsconferences.com/">http://devopsconferences.com/</a> </strong></p>

<p>Because DevOps is so new, there is high demand for experts to share best practices with the greater community. Some of these conferences revolve around specific tools like Chef, Puppet or Docker, while others, such as Velocity and DevOpsDays, focus on DevOps in a broad and general way.</p>

<p>Any good hiring strategy should incorporate all of the above. It can be time-consuming, but a multi-front approach will yield the best results. In the words of Frank Odia, a Portland-based DevOps and Big Data recruiter, &ldquo;There is no hidden pool of talent. You have to try a lot of different things. It takes a lot of networking and presenting your company as a great place to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>BUILDING YOUR TEAM TO SCALE</strong></p>

<p>Assembling a winning team means thinking beyond the individual developer and focusing on how your organization operates as a whole. Each area below should be considered:</p>

<p><strong>Developing Your Talent</strong></p>

<p>Your greatest, untapped talent pool may be right where you&rsquo;re standing. Because DevOps skills are in such high demand, many organizations are moving to infuse those skills into their current staff. Prashanth Chandrasekar from Rackspace addressed this challenge by converting those in traditional system administrator roles to DevOps engineers. &ldquo;We are going through the active process of training them,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;because we don&rsquo;t feel there are enough of them out there. It gives people aspirational learning opportunities and gives traditional sys admins relevance in their careers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Retaining Your Talent</strong></p>

<p>In its 2014 State of DevOps Report<sup>3</sup>, Puppet Labs confirmed that organizational culture is key to retaining talent. A team&rsquo;s culture and whether it fosters an atmosphere conducive to learning are the two primary determinants of job satisfaction among DevOps engineers&mdash;even eclipsing salary by a significant margin. According to Frank Odia, in order to interest qualified candidates, &ldquo;companies are being much more flexible. You take them where they are. They don&rsquo;t have to be in an office; they can work from a home office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By creating a great place to work, businesses can keep the talent they have happy. Beyond the productivity gains that come along with job satisfaction, this strategy will also act as a magnet for qualified candidates in the market place.</p>

<p><strong>Team Leadership</strong></p>

<p>According to the Chicago Tribune,<sup>4</sup> &ldquo;Getting along with your boss or knowing your boss likes you can be more important than pay or benefits when it comes to job satisfaction.&rdquo; But the benefits of satisfied workers go beyond employee retention. A bad leader can drag down a high-performing team, while a great leader will inspire his or her staff to take action, take risks and innovate.</p>

<p>The leader of a DevOps team needs to be able to facilitate and inspire communication between teammates to make sure that there are blameless postmortems, rather than an &ldquo;us-versus-them&rdquo; mentality.</p>

<p>In Chandrasekar&rsquo;s case, the leader he chose for his DevOps team was someone who came up through the ranks&mdash;someone with credibility among his team, earned by developing products at Rackspace. He was the ideal leader to instill a DevOps mindset in his team, because he embraced a collaborative cultural approach in his own work. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve done it before,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you have solved the same problems that the engineers are facing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A leader who understands the technical problems and can help his team overcome them in a collaborative fashion is a major asset to any DevOps team.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Outside Help</strong></p>

<p>When companies try to implement DevOps, they quickly run into barriers. Configuration management tools have steep learning curves, and necessary organizational changes can be met with internal resistance. Because DevOps is such a new practice, companies won&rsquo;t find the slew of external consultants that are common in other areas of IT.</p>

<p>But there are companies like Rackspace that have been deploying in a DevOps fashion since before the term was coined. Whether companies are looking for an outside expert to help ease their organizational transition or someone to run their infrastructure (treating it as code), these kinds of outside services can be useful extensions of their internal development team.</p>
