<p><strong>CUSTOMER&rsquo;S BUSINESS:</strong> Samba Tech is a Brazilian company that uses a pioneering online video platform to provide professional online video solutions to major corporations and media groups in Brazil and throughout Latin America, helping clients manage, distribute, analyze, and monetize video content for computer, TV and mobile.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> Samba Tech works for many of Brazil&rsquo;s biggest companies and media groups, including 4 of the 5 largest cable companies, and has managed video content for such high-profile events as the 2010 Winter Olympics. To ensure they deliver for their clients, Samba Tech needs high-level technical support and SLAs from their own service providers.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE</strong><strong>&reg; </strong><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Public Cloud</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Hosting</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> The company has experienced continuous growth in both physical and economic terms. They have opened offices&#x2028in Argentina to manage their growing Latin American presence, expanded their service offerings, formed new partnerships, and received millions in investment dollars. As the company continues to evolve and broaden its scope, Samba Tech has consistently stayed at the forefront of Brazil&rsquo;s emerging tech scene.</p>
<p><strong>The Brazilian online video platform gives companies a better way to manage and distribute video content on TV, computer, and mobile screens.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samba Tech has gone through many changes since it was founded in 2004, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In its first few years, the company completely shifted its focus from mobile games to online video distribution, and then developed proprietary technology that allowed it to rapidly overtake competitors and meet the significant demand for this service in the Brazilian market.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the company has honed its position as Brazil&rsquo;s market leader for online video distribution, opened offices in Argentina to coordinate operations all over Latin America, received millions in investment dollars, and formed partnerships with international institutions like MIT, which provides Samba Tech with a steady stream of interns and advisers from the Sloane School of Management, through the Global Entrepreneurship Lab (G-lab).</p>
<p>Throughout its evolution, Samba Tech has stayed focused on Brazil and on meeting the shifting demands of this rapidly growing economy, while Founder and CEO, Gustavo Caetano has stayed at the forefront of Brazil&rsquo;s nascent tech scene, regularly singled out for his influence on Brazilian startup culture and for his drive to innovate in a country where the cultural outlook and bureaucracy are often unfriendly to entrepreneurs. Caetano has been voted Brazil&rsquo;s best CEO and, more recently, was recognized as one of MIT Technology Review&rsquo;s &ldquo;Top 10 Entrepreneurs under 35.&rdquo; Samba Tech currently counts virtually all of Brazil&rsquo;s biggest media operations among its clients, using its online video platform to help these media producers distribute their content across multiple channels, from computer, to television, to mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>Rackspace Client Since 2009</strong></p>
<p>Samba Tech has been a Rackspace customer since 2009, using a hybrid solution with both dedicated hosting and public cloud to run the different types of applications they need to do business. As Fernando Campos, former CTO of Samba Tech, explains, the hybrid solution suits Samba Tech well because certain applications, like databases, require a dedicated solution while the cloud is perfect for many other parts of their system. &ldquo;Being able to do both at the same time, with such a powerful solution like the one you have here is the best,&rdquo; he affirms.</p>
<p><strong>FANATICAL SUPPORT</strong><strong>&reg;</strong></p>
<p>Gustavo Caetano says before coming to Rackspace, Samba Tech tried other infrastructure and solutions providers but they became frustrated with the lack of support and SLAs. &ldquo;We decided to move to Rackspace because of the famous Fanatical Support,&rdquo; he explains, and adds that Rackspace was able to provide the kind of demanding SLAs required by the types of clients they work with in Brazil.</p>
<p>When asked what <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/support/promise/"><strong>Fanatical Support</strong>&reg;</a>&nbsp;means to him, Caetano says it&rsquo;s about making the customer happy, and says that the Rackspace team meets the mark at Samba Teach, frequently delivering what&nbsp;he calls &ldquo;good surprises&rdquo; to his own team. Indeed, Caetano says he has learned a lot from observing Rackspace and the way they carry out the philosophy of Fanatical Support, and that they seek to emulate it in their own business practices. &ldquo;We use Rackspace as an internal benchmark of customer relationships and support,&rdquo; he explains. Campos agrees, saying that this goes a long way toward explaining why Samba Tech and Rackspace are a good fit: &ldquo;You treat us like we like to treat our customers, so I think it&rsquo;s a perfect match.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Distance Doesn&rsquo;t Matter</strong></p>
<p>Although Rackspace doesn&rsquo;t have data centers in Brazil, or anywhere near Samba Tech&rsquo;s headquarters, Caetano says the distance hasn&rsquo;t impacted Rackspace ability to deliver on their promise of Fanatical Support. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very far from Brazil by distance,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re very close to our team on a daily basis. We work very closely with the Rackspace support team and also with the technical team, and that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really important for us.</p>
