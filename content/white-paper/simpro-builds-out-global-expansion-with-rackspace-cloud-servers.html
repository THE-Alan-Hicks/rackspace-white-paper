<p><strong>CHALLENGES: </strong>Address rapid company growth through effective global delivery of web-based software.</p>

<p><strong>RACKSPACE<sup>® </sup>SOLUTION:</strong> <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers">Rackspace Dedicated Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting">Rackspace Managed Cloud Servers</a></p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> Web-based applications run 20% faster, with I/O wait times slashed by 40%. simPRO added global capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Rackspace high-performance infrastructure helps accelerate application, slash wait times</strong></p>

<p>Australia’s simPRO Software has built a thriving firm helping tradespeople use the cloud to run their businesses. simPRO is the global leader in job management software for the services and contracting sector. Established in 2002, the company’s clients range from small contractors to huge trade service firms with thousands of employees. To support and enhance its web-based software, simPRO has operations in Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.</p>

<p>simPRO clients appreciate how the cloud- based software helps them streamline their operations and generate better results. One major advantage is real-time mobility. Field service people can use an iPhone or Android device to check work orders, update estimates, and complete forms from anywhere. This saves hours of travel and rekeying scribbled notes, and speeds invoicing and collections. Overall, the system dramatically boosts what the company calls the “three Pro’s” of simPRO: processes, productivity, and profits.</p>

<p><strong>NO MORE HARDWARE HEADACHES</strong></p>

<p>At first, simPRO ran its own servers, dealing with all the headaches of sourcing, buying, and tweaking hardware. “We used to manage all of our infrastructure ourselves and we found there was a heavy overhead and cost,” said Jonathan Eastgate, simPRO’s CTO. Every time the company added a few new clients, they had to buy more hardware and set it up.</p>

<p>To eliminate these chores, simPRO tried outsourcing servers to local providers. But they couldn’t get what they needed: bulletproof support, a range of services, and a global presence that could handle the company’s expansion. The company began looking for the right partner with a full range of services and top-flight support to keep simPRO’s customers productive, both on the road and back at the office.</p>

<p>Eventually, simPRO found what they were looking for in Rackspace. The company offered a mantra of <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about">Fanatical Support<sup>TM</sup></a>, a wide range of services from bare metal to hybrid cloud, and worldwide reach. SimPRO moved all its workloads to Rackspace in 2010. At first, the company used both <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid">dedicated and cloud servers</a>, with a main data center in Chicago and sites in Dallas and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Today, simPRO is migrating to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers">high-performance cloud servers with SSD storage</a>, and adding access points in the UK and across the U.S. to generate faster speed for users anywhere in the world. For example, I/O wait has been slashed 40% on database instances deployed with SSD <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/block-storage">Cloud Block Storage</a>—a flexible, on-demand storage option from Rackspace. In addition, simPRO has reduced its costs; due to the lower cost per instance, the firm now deploys almost one-third more web-server capacity.</p>

<p>“The move to Rackspace has meant not having to worry about infrastructure or hardware costs, so we can focus on deploying our software on Rackspace’s great infrastructure,” said Eastgate. “And the Rackspace team gives us really handy advice on how to grow our systems to suit our global expansion.”</p>

<p><strong>FINDING A GREAT PARTNER IN RACKSPACE</strong></p>

<p>“Since our move to the Rackspace cloud, we’ve seen a massive increase in responsiveness in all our applications,” said Eastgate. <strong>In fact, application response has improved 20% overall, compared to the earlier physical infrastructure.</strong> “Clients get fast access to our systems, no matter where they are in the world. That ease of growing globally makes Rackspace a great avenue for any company that wants to take its product worldwide.”</p>

<p>Today, simPRO is preparing for its next major product update by migrating to high-performance cloud servers with SSD storage, and is adding access points in Australia, the UK, and across the United States to generate faster speed for users anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The fabled Fanatical Support from Rackspace enables simPRO’s team to get on with the job of building out its client base, without worrying about infrastructure. “Rackspace’s Fanatical Support means we’ve got infrastructure and support people available by phone 24/7. Our account manager in Sydney can escalate our call to any operational person in any data center around the world, to give us the fastest possible resolution,” said Eastgate. “No other provider could offer this.”</p>

<p>Would simPRO executives recommend Rackspace? “I have recommended Rackspace to many other CTO’s because of the level of service and the great relationship we have with the team in Sydney,” Eastgate said. “We see Rackspace as a partner in what we do, not a provider. And that makes a big difference.”</p>

<p>The company CEO agrees. “As the business is growing geographically and our product is growing in breadth and depth, we need to have confidence that our partners can scale with us and deliver what we’re looking for in capacity and support,” said simPRO CEO Brad Couper. “We have great confidence in Rackspace. They really deliver the value that we’re looking for in a technology partner.”</p>
