For over seven years, Tier1 has been providing IT services for Oracle software services. &ldquo;We use email for a lot of things. In addition to project work, we operate a help desk for customers. It&rsquo;s important for us to have dependable email that&rsquo;s always up and available. There&rsquo;s a lot of initial communication when a problem arises, and email lets us know when customers are having problems,&rdquo; says Rob Guidarelli, President of Tier1.<br /><br />They had already decided hosting was the ideal option and had worked with a few email providers. But, according to Rob, &ldquo;Our past email providers had lots of downtime and performance issues. Email was frequently delayed and we wouldn&rsquo;t even know it.&rdquo; Without dedicated IT resources, &ldquo;It was important we found a solution that was easy to use, and we could depend on to be there for us,&rdquo; says Rob.</p><h3>IMAP Access Seals the Deal</h3><p>The user base at Tier1 is mobile, like most modern businesses, making IMAP access a requirement for their new email service. &ldquo;It was important to me to find an offering with an IMAP solution. The nature of our business requires that employees access email from different devices on the go.&rdquo;</p><p>He found Rackspace Email &amp; Apps&rsquo; mix of Hosted Exchange and Rackspace Email met all his needs. Our Hosted Exchange offering delivers the full functionality of an in-house Exchange configuration without the maintenance, upgrades, and patching. Rackspace Email is an affordable webmail client with calendar, contacts, tasks, notes, and free mobile sync. Rob recalls, &ldquo;An integrated calendar system was also important. We looked at customer reference stories and pricing, and you had the best of the whole bundle.&rdquo;</p><p>Rob is especially happy with the accessibility of his email data. &ldquo;The web interface is very easy to use for employees out at customer sites or from customer laptops. We use a number of different technologies&mdash;Mac<sup>&reg;</sup>, BlackBerry<sup>&reg;</sup>, Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>, iPhone<sup>&reg;</sup>, and Palm<sup>&reg;</sup> phones&mdash;and you provide great support for all of them. It&rsquo;s a fully functional email solution from any computer, anywhere,&rdquo; Rob says.</p><h3>Solid Email Service That&rsquo;s Easy to Manage</h3><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that easy. You don&rsquo;t have to be technical to manage it. Everything is very simple to use. We&rsquo;re hiring a lot of people right now. It&rsquo;s so easy I can have my assistant go in and set up new mailboxes, and add new users. It&rsquo;s very simple from an admin perspective,&rdquo; says Rob. &#x2028&#x2028They&rsquo;ve been able to take advantage of having a solid email solution by converting invoice distribution to an email process, and saving all that paper. He&rsquo;s able to do this because, with their Rackspace email hosting service, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to worry about messages not going through in a timely manner,&rdquo; Rob shares.</p><p>He gives the Rackspace webmail interface high marks. &ldquo;Your webmail is equally as good as any mail client out there,&rdquo; he states. They also use the shared, online calendars for at-a-glance calendar viewing across the domain to quickly schedule meetings.</p><p><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup></a> is an integral part of all of our hosting services. Rob states, &ldquo;Whatever product or service I buy, customer service and responsiveness is the most important criteria. In every company, things go wrong. It&rsquo;s the nature of the game. But to have a company that will respond quickly, and be as thorough in their responses as Rackspace is, makes all the difference.&rdquo; When he first got his iPhone, he sent an email to support with some questions and within minutes had an email back with answers to all of them.</p><p>Of his overall experience with Rackspace, Rob states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one less thing I have to worry about. We&rsquo;re an IT company, but thanks to Rackspace, we don&rsquo;t need an internal IT department. Knowing our customers have the ability to communicate with us and contact us when they need us, is not something I have to worry about anymore.&rdquo;</p>
