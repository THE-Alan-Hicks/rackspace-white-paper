Seeking smart ways to expand, the company began to explore options in the Rackspace cloud, comparing costs of managed infrastructure versus a hybrid cloud solution.</p><p><strong>RACKSPACE SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise-cloud-solutions/advisory-services/">Rackspace Advisory Services</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise-cloud-solutions/advisory-services/#cloud-readiness-assessment">Cloud Readiness Assessment</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Servers</a></p><p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>Rackspace Advisory Services implements the Cloud Readiness Assessment, providing Pearl.com with an in-depth analysis of equipment usage and a number of recommendations of how they could use a hybrid hosting model with their own managed hosting infrastructure to deal with burst capacity.</p><h3><strong>Rackspace offers a hybrid cloud roadmap via the Cloud Readiness Assessment. </strong></h3><p>Pearl.com aims to make the world better by connecting customers for one-on-one online conversations with nearly 200 different types of verified professionals to help answer questions and solve problems, from the everyday to the life-changing. The company started in 2003 when San Francisco based entrepreneur Andy Kurtzig and his wife Sara were expecting their first child, so he created a site to provide answers from doctors and other professionals at any time.</p><p>Having already helped resolve some 5 million unique customer inquiries, the company, formerly known as JustAnswer, was rebranded in 2012. The Better Business Bureau has recognized Pearl.com with an A+ rating, and the company maintains relationships with other high-profile counsel providers such as Dr. Phil.com, PetMD and Car Talk. Pearl.com is now one of the largest and fastest growing providers of access to professional services online, increasing revenue for 33 quarters since inception and grown an average of 123% per year since 2008.</p><p>Allison Bucchere, Head of User Experience, Design &amp; Copy at Pearl.com says, “At Pearl. com we are really passionate about helping thousands of people every day. We are replacing their worries with peace of mind. Whether you are just wondering about your rights, and you have a question for a lawyer, you can get an answer right away. We are excited to get out of bed every morning just to help people.”</p><p>In order to continue helping thousands of people daily on a transactional website, hosting services are critical to Pearl.com. Infrastructure redundancies in the Pearl.com network, at the systems and applications layers have been improved over the years to ensure uptime for customers and professionals. The company needed to understand from an internal point of view how a Rackspace hybrid cloud solution could accelerate growth, reduce costs, and help its customers succeed.</p><p><strong>Assessing Your Cloud Readiness</strong></p><p>The Rackspace Cloud Readiness Assessment provides customers the detailed intelligence and insight necessary to complete their strategic IT vision and make game-changing, innovative decisions regarding their cloud computing strategy. Facilitating the Cloud Readiness Assessment is the Rackspace Advisory Services team, providing ever-present <strong>Fanatical Support </strong>during your strategic IT planning process.</p><p>Enterprise IT Architects work with your company’s key IT stakeholders to evaluate applications in your infrastructure that are candidates for migration and provide a concrete recommendation for cloud adoption. This is accomplished through a series of interviews, consultative sessions, review of your current application portfolio, and multi- dimensional infrastructure analysis spanning several weeks in order to create a seamless journey to the cloud.</p><p>Pearl.com VP of Engineering Adam Cohen explains, “We did the Cloud Readiness Assessment because we were trying to understand if we could use the cloud to put some of our services in and to do more demand usage then having just full time servers. We’ve been using managed hosting for years, and we pay for those machines, 24/7. As our traffic ebbs and flows during the day, could we be more efficient with the dollars we’re spending with our IT budget?”</p><p><strong>Making a Cloud Adoption Decision </strong></p><p>Agreeing to engage in the Rackspace Cloud Readiness Assessment, Cohen says, “I was worried I was going to get a sales pitch from Rackspace. And it turned out very different, which I was very pleased with. They really came in and spent an enormous amount of time understanding the detail of how we were running our equipment, and ended up providing a lot of valuable information to understand what we were doing and how we were using our stuff.”</p><p>Pearl.com prefers to control their entire Rackspace infrastructure as much as possible, but having equipment sitting around idle isn’t very useful. A Rackspace hybrid cloud solution for Pearl.com will allow them to expand the company’s web presence as traffic ebbs and flows during a 24 hour period. During the day, the company experiences high loads of traffic which slows down in the evening, and a hybrid cloud solution should allow Pearl.com to reduce its cost footprint with Rackspace.</p><p>“At the end of the assessment, Rackspace provided us with a lot of output, and reports with an enormous amount of detail using the cloud to run our business. It opened our eyes to the most valuable part of the assessment, the understanding of the level that we were using our equipment,” says Cohen. “I had always felt that we were doing a pretty good job, but didn’t really know, and it was very nice to have those suspicions confirmed. They had gone through the detail of our systems and found we were running our equipment pretty hot all the time and we didn’t have a lot of gear that is sitting idle every day.”</p><p><strong>Journeying To The Cloud </strong></p><p>“When I think about the assessment and what my expectations were, I wanted to get a better understanding of how we were using the different suite of Rackspace products and was trying to figure out what we should be thinking about when we do our own architecture and grow our products, says Cohen. “The Cloud Readiness Assessment gave us the tools to think about how to integrate other Rackspace products. The cloud is specifically interesting to us in terms of being able to turn machines on and off at Rackspace much more quickly than we can today. That’s one of the things that we are looking at to use in the future to do some of our burst computing that we need to do in our hosted environment.”</p><p>Pearl.com is looking ahead, exploring upcoming adoption of either Rackspace public or private cloud flexibility to meet critical customer and uptime needs. According to Cohen, the move into hybrid cloud will reduce costs and help the company with response time by being able to scale servers based on intermediate demand. “Investing in some of these projects will have quick payback as we move forward.”</p><p>Over the years, Rackspace and Pearl.com continue to strengthen their relationship. “It’s going to be long and fruitful, concludes Cohen. “As we’ve grown, we’ve faced numerous challenges, and Rackspace has always stepped up to the plate. The people there are amazing.”</p><p><em>SOURCE:<br /> 1. Pearl.com Fact Sheet (http://info.pearl.com/Pearl.com_FactSheet.pdf)</em></p>
