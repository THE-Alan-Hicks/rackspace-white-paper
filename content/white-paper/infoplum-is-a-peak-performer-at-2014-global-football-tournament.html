<p><strong>Challenges: </strong>Scale resources to meet dramatic, peak traffic delivering a variety of media to a worldwide audience.</p>

<p><strong>Business Outcome: </strong>Reliable backend support during record- high demand, and consistent global content delivery with unprecedented coverage and distribution.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aussie sports content innovator, AFP and Rackspace score with global fans through record high traffic.</em></strong></p>

<p>Since its inception in 1990 (as Cadability), infoplum has been a pioneer in the Australian multimedia market, connecting millions to the information they need. Using cutting-edge technologies to develop innovative applications in the sporting world, this mobile-led IT company is focused on developing and delivering engaging content for major world sporting events.</p>

<p>“Content is an undeniable asset, but the true differentiation is in how we present information, through the innovative use of technology,” said Arun Khanna, Managing Director of infoplum. “We started with a whole approach and philosophy to capture our own data into a database structure, from day one.”</p>

<p>“All of our platforms are proprietary. We build our own capture interfaces, databases, the processing and delivery platforms, web surfaces and frontend applications.” said Trevor George, infoplum’s Technical Director.</p>

<p>“Our focus is on continually improving the speed of delivery of that content and the technologies that support it.”</p>

<p>During the world’s single largest sporting event, the Melbourne-based company provided a worldwide audience of more than 126 clients in 26 countries with live scores, highlights, news, photos, video, and 3D footage, with interactive information fully connected to social media networks and images from Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>

<p>“We work with clients to provide a range of innovative and engaging products, whether feeds or applications, always thinking of the user, their audience, their customers, and how they would react,” said Angelo Tilocca, infoplum General Manager of Business Development.</p>

<p><strong>Addressing Unprecedented Traffic With Ease</strong></p>

<p>For the event coverage, infoplum would need a system that could scale, adjust, and deliver in a large context. As global football fans tracked the results of the month-long tournament, infoplum, AFP and Rackspace teamed up to deliver updates relying on Rackspace Cloud Sites to stay up and running throughout record peak traffic.</p>

<p>The project involved delivery of not only infoplum content but also from AFP, whose images and editorial had to be precisely processed and delivered seamlessly. The infoplum application was embedded on 161 websites, served to a worldwide audience in 12 languages. The result, 4.1 billion hits.</p>

<p>“We had 90-plus terabytes of data to deliver, and we needed an infrastructure partner capable of handling that. Without the facilities and the commitment from the Rackspace team, it simply wouldn’t have happened,” said George.</p>

<p>Over this 32-day period, the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/sites">Rackspace Cloud Sites</a> operations team ensured enough nodes were configured in the high-capacity cluster for the expected load. Throughout the month, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/">Rackspace engineers</a> monitored infoplum’s environment and made any necessary adjustments to ensure infoplum could handle demand.</p>

<p><strong>Phenomenal Result, Fanatical Support<sup>®</sup></strong></p>

<p>This was our biggest project to date, utilizing the support of AFP, Rackspace and our office in India,” said Tilocca. “Combined, our effort meant that our clients and their audiences didn’t miss a beat. They followed the emotion, the passion and the results, and then we saw that by how many people viewed and engaged with the audience – and how many people engaged with the product: More than 126 clients, 26 countries, 12 different languages; 4.1 billion hits and 125 million pageviews... unprecedented coverage and distribution.”</p>

<p>Knowing that Rackspace was on watch gave infoplum leadership peace of mind throughout the project. “When you’re dealing with sports, there is no such thing as latency,” said Khanna. “So when we are working around the clock, covering an event, we need a company that is working alongside us to manage it. That’s what we expect and that’s what I believe <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/">Fanatical Support</a> is all about.”</p>

<p>“One of the reasons I like Rackspace is being able to talk to the people who are doing what needs to be done,” said George. “Their commitment to our requirements was terrific. I didn’t see the ops team’s actual operations centre, but they told me they’d printed out the event fixture of matches and had it plastered up around the walls so they knew when to expect loads and to prepare in advance for those sorts of things. We knew we had a team behind us that was truly interested in making our event a success.”</p>

<p>The event was the reason infoplum went to Rackspace because of its global context.</p>

<p>“We had never done this before on such a scale, so the risk was considerable for us, and we felt we needed to go to the best infrastructure provider that we could imagine,” said George.</p>

<p>“We’re playing in a global market now, and we need to be ready for it, and that’s why partnerships such as Rackspace and our global partnership with the AFP, one of the world’s largest and experienced news agencies, are paramount to our success,” said Tilocca.</p>
