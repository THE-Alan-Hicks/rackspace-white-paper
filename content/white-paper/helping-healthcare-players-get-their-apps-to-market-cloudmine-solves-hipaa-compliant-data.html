<p><strong>Challenges: </strong>Deliver reliable and scalable platform with encrypted data storage. Handle unpredictable, spiky traffic from myriad devices running on variant bandwidth.</p>

<p><strong>Rackspace<sup>®</sup> Solution: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers">Dedicated</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud">Cloud Servers with Managed Service Level</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect">RackConnect</a>, <a href="http://objectrocket.com/">ObjectRocket</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Business Outcome: </strong>Reduced operating cost, higher confidence in security of sensitive data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rackspace relationship lowers cost and improves security.</em></strong></p>

<p>Whenever a major industry such as healthcare is overhauled, even the savviest players need to know quickly how to navigate change.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Philadelphia, enterprise mobility specialist CloudMine is helping healthcare and pharmaceuticals customers improve efficiency and data security in a rapidly evolving marketplace of mobile devices and apps.</p>

<p>“Our software sits between the large set of corporate data systems that exist today, such as Oracle, Peoplesoft, and well-known electronic medical record (EMR) systems, and bridges that data securely to mobile and connected devices attached to the public Internet,” said Marc Weil, CloudMine CTO.</p>

<p>CloudMine customers and prospects need to be able to use mobile apps and connected devices to stay competitive, while also addressing the data storage and usage requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act’s (HIPAA) Privacy and Security rules.</p>

<p>“Companies are investing in mobility, such as the production of iPad applications for improving doctor-patient communication,” said Weil. “With Rackspace, we have an HIPAA-compliant solution that ensures our customers’ ability to build these applications securely while still taking advantage of the parts of CloudMine that increase speed-to-market and reduce TCO for these apps.”</p>

<p>CloudMine’s customers are investing in many new state-of-the-art technologies in their industries. Pharmaceutical companies are building Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled medical devices such as personal glucose sensors, heart rate monitors, and medicine injectors that use CloudMine to store all the patient-specific data that each device collects. Analytics and data processing solutions can later use this data to gain insight into improving medication compliance and product usability.</p>

<p>“We built our platform as the foundation for this,” said Weil. “The challenge is getting data into and out of a large variety of devices running on many different cellular networks in a secure manner, all while keeping the product easy to use for the developer.”</p>

<p><strong>The Cloudmine Solution, Powered By Rackspace</strong></p>

<p>CloudMine was more than up for the challenge, but to really nail it they also recognized they would need to work with a provider like Rackspace that could design and deliver a reliable and secure <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid">hybrid solution</a> to store sensitive data and scale to handle traffic.</p>

<p>Rackspace allows CloudMine to focus on what it does best without having to worry about infrastructure. “Every business needs a support structure,” Weil said. “No matter what you’re building, you’re always relying on a partner or a vendor to supply the underpinnings. It’s really nice to know that Rackspace is just a phone call away.”</p>

<p>CloudMine can concentrate properly on data in and out of the MongoDB opensource database while Rackspace expertly handles administration, replication, backups, encryption and more.</p>

<p>“Rackspace has allowed us to do is to augment our internal Ops team with the ObjectRocket team within Rackspace,” said Weil. “This allows our engineers to focus on higher value tasks.”</p>

<p>And of course, there’s the legendary <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/">Rackspace Fanatical Support<sup>®</sup></a>. Added Weil: “Rackspace is willing to roll up its sleeves and work with us to design a tailored, optimal architecture for our solution. Our contacts do a fantastic job of walking us through our solution – even helping us implement and test it before putting it in production. It’s like having our own <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/devops">DevOps engineering team</a> outside of CloudMine.”</p>

<p><strong>A Secure Future</strong></p>

<p>Everyone from engineers and architects to federal regulators is trying to figure out what defines a secure cloud environment. With HIPAA compliance, security becomes an essential of CloudMine’s business. The extensive <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/security/solutions/">cloud security expertise of Rackspace</a> staff helps CloudMine meet its various customers’ security audit processes.</p>

<p>Now CloudMine is able to provide its customers with all the security information and audits that Rackspace has undergone for their datacenters as a show of proof that the company is storing its data in a secure location, in a manner customers are familiar with.</p>

<p>“We have part of our platform deployed on dedicated, bare metal boxes with no virtualization layer running in a datacenter that we know everything about,” said Weil. “And we have some of our technology running in a secure cloud environment as well, integrated with our bare metal using RackConnect.”</p>

<p>As CloudMine looks to what’s next, the company feels good about Rackspace as a partner as it develops more and varied mobile offerings. “Right now, we’re speaking with Rackspace about additional managed CloudMine deployments,” Weil said. “Rackspace has really shown a true investment and value in us, not only as a customer, but also as a partner. And that’s something that we really appreciate.”</p>
