<h3><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>By 2015, global ecommerce sales are projected to top $338 billion<sup>1</sup>. To keep up with the growth, retailers are seeking out technology solutions that allow them to deliver customer experience and performance efficiencies to take advantage of the growth. The majority of ecommerce technology decisions are being driven by these trends that are changing the ecommerce landscape:</p>

<p><strong>TREND #1: MORE TRAFFIC</strong><br />
Shoppers on mobile devices, smartphones, and desktops have sustained double-digit growth in online spending for over a decade<sup>2</sup>. In 2013, weekend sales traffic ballooned four times the pace of weekday sales<sup>3</sup>. The crush of performance demands to keep up with the increased traffic is pushing ecommerce operators to re-think the technology that fuels their sales engines.</p>

<p><strong>TREND #2: OMNI-CHANNEL COMMERCE</strong><br />
In-store, kiosk, mobile, and web are becoming increasingly integrated into omni-channel commerce. Channel integration allows 37 percent of U.S. consumers the ability to use their smartphones while in a brick and mortar store to check prices, inventory, or options or to even purchase a product<sup>4</sup>. This model requires traditionally fragmented channels to share and process information across multiple sales platforms.</p>

<p><strong>TREND #3: EVOLVED SHOPPERS</strong><br />
Though retailers consistently rank at the top of the industry rankings for customer experience, a majority of consumers (61%) rate ecommerce customer experience as okay, poor, or very poor<sup>5</sup> leaving a lot of room for progress. To improve experience often means improving underlying systems from the front end all the way down to the hardware running it to support enhanced, customized, and brand differentiating experiences.</p>

<p><strong>TREND #4: GLOBAL AND LOCAL MARKETPLACES</strong><br />
The macro demands of delivering consistent site performance across continents is coming fast on the heels of the demand for more personalized experiences based on location-aware tools that work on the micro level. Both marketplace challenges require creative thinking backed by strong technology solutions for execution.</p>

<p>Oracle Commerce is designed to meet the emerging challenges of ecommerce. When customized by a skilled System Integrator (SI), it can generate extraordinary results. However, the hosted infrastructure is the critical foundation that makes it all possible. Whether supporting Oracle Commerce users directly, or in partnership with leading Oracle Commerce System Integrators (SI), Rackspace delivers Oracle Commerce customers infrastructure, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/whyrackspace/">Fanatical Support<sup>®</sup></a> for the overall environment, and deep application expertise for Oracle ATG Web Commerce, Oracle Endeca, and Oracle Database. Services include architecting, installing, configuring, deploying and monitoring Oracle Commerce applications for more relevant, personalized, and consistent experiences across multiple online channels</p>

<p>This white paper will explore how <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/oracle-retail/">Critical Application Services for Oracle Commerce at Rackspace</a> provides the best hosting platform and application management services for Oracle’s market-leading ecommerce solution.</p>

<p>The vertical integration of hardware and services for application management can lead to benefits that could not be achieved through other means, for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>100% production platform uptime guarantee. The highest level of possible availability within a single data center</li>
	<li>Support for customer experience initiatives. When customers are more satisfied due to high availability and fast performance, increased conversion rates follow.</li>
	<li>Transform return on investment (ROI). Improved performance and converting CAPEX to OPEX can lead to higher conversion rates and increased profits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these benefits make Rackspace hosting and application management services for Oracle Commerce an unparalleled platform for ecommerce operation.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Oracle Commerce – A Leading Ecommerce Platform</strong></h3>

<p>Oracle Commerce leads the pack and is identified as a leader in Gartner’s 2013 Magic Quadrant for E-Commerce. Increasingly, retailers are realizing the need to support cross-channel commerce, search, and personalization. Oracle refers to this as, Commerce Anywhere, allowing customers to interact with brands on their own terms. This trend is reinforced by findings from the Oracle 2013 B2B Commerce Trends survey showing personalization, online catalogs, and SEO as the top B2C practices most influencing revenue. The survey also reports a third of respondents plan on investing in cross-channel integration and managing and leveraging product content to improve customer experience.</p>

<p>Customers now expect relevant, personalized, and consistent experiences across the multiple touch points they engage with to make purchase decisions. Retailers are now forced to manage and scale consumer-driven, cross-channel experiences and meet business goals. This balancing act results in cobbling together siloed tools and systems to support online channels. These technology limitations create frustration and degraded customer experiences for users and missed goals for retailers.</p>

<p>Oracle got ahead of the trend by acquiring both ATG for cross-channel commerce and Endeca for customer experience. These assets have been combined as <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/commerce/overview/index.html?origref=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/commerce/atg/index.html">Oracle Commerce</a>. The Oracle Commerce Solution unifies best in class commerce applications focused on personalized user experiences, business user enablement, and scalability to meet the evolving demands of commerce. Oracle Commerce consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Oracle ATG Web Commerce:</strong> A robust development framework, built on over 10 million lines of Java code. On top of this framework is a set of pre-built functionality. ATG is primarily used for B2C commerce through the web channel but it may also be used for B2B and C2C across channels ranging from mobile to embedded video game consoles. ATG uses a traditional three-tier architecture, with a relational database in the back-end.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Oracle Endeca:</strong> An in-memory columnar database and a framework for loading and querying data. The columnar database is used for typical search queries (e.g. “red shirt”), faceted navigation queries (e.g. show all red shirts &lt; $10), and for the placement of content on pages (e.g. which product should fill the hero image slot on the home page). Endeca is deployed as a series of standalone C/C++ executables accessible over web services.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>3. Rackspace Hosting – A Retail Hosting Specialist</strong></h3>

<p>For the third consecutive year, InternetRetailer.com named <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/top-tech/">Rackspace the number one hosting provider to the top 1,000</a> retailers in the US.

<h3><strong>5. Considerations for Oracle Commerce</strong></h3>

<p>Before implementing Oracle Commerce, use these questions to help you guide, plan and execute a your ideal Oracle solution:</p>

<p>Basic Platform Questions</p>

<ul>
	<li>What version of Web Commerce Solution is being implemented (both ATG and Endeca)?</li>
	<li>What Operating System and version number is the solution being implemented on?</li>
	<li>What database and version number is the solution being implemented with?</li>
	<li>What Application Server (JBOSS/Weblogic) and JDK (Sun/JRockit) will be used (also need version numbers if possible)?</li>
	<li>What modules of ATG will be implemented (Commerce (estore), Content Administration (BCC/CA), Commerce Service Center (CSC))?</li>
	<li>Any special instances of Commerce (mobile, bot, kiosk, etc) that may need to be separated if Multi-Site is not used?</li>
	<li>If Endeca is used, will Experience Manager be required (this is typically yes but depends on the implementation)?</li>
	<li>Will Coherence or a Data Grid be part of the solution?</li>
	<li>Will Session Replication be required?</li>
</ul>

<p>Sizing Qusetions</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is the anticipated peak traffic volume (typically holiday traffic)?</li>
	<li>What is the typical weekly peak traffic volume (non-holiday)?</li>
	<li>How many orders are associated with the traffic asked in the previous questions?</li>
	<li>Any SLA requirements for page load times and if so what are the anticipated page sizes? (i.e. &lt; 4 second homepage and &lt; 1 sec product page)</li>
	<li>Any “burst” instances anticipated? (Burst instances are instances that are started up to handle heavy loads of traffic to avoid outages)</li>
	<li>What are the current JVM sizes recommended by development for the various types of instances? (BCC/CA typically is very large while some instances of estore can be very small)</li>
	<li>Are there an estimated number of instances needed for each environment (DEV, QA, Prod) and for each module type? (Number of estore instances (divided by type if needed (e.g. estore, bot, mobile, lock manager, etc)), number of CSC instances if CSC is implemented, and if BCC/CA is clustered (non-standard) number of instances anticipated)</li>
</ul>
