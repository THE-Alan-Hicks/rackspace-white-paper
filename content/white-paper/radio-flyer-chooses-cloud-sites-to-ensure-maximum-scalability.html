Based in Chicago, Radio Flyer is the #1 wagon maker and the #1 trike maker in the industry. Since the creation of the Original Red Wagon that lent the company its name, the brand has expanded to create trikes, bikes, wagons, ride-ons, specialty items and a mini line for imaginative play. As the new millennium gains momentum, Radio Flyer is still in the driver&rsquo;s seat, creating tomorrow&rsquo;s innovative products with the same classic quality and sheer sense of play that have been their trademarks from the beginning.<br /><br />&ldquo;When the time came for Radio Flyer to make the transition into the cloud, we needed a solution that offered the support and scalability to propel us to the next level,&rdquo; said Tom Cesario, director of information technology for Radio Flyer. &ldquo;Our business is growing and we&rsquo;re reaching out to customers in new ways that will bring them to our site. We believe a cloud approach is the best path for us in order to support unpredictable traffic spikes and the customer service provided by Rackspace has been superb &ndash; allowing us to focus on strategic business issues and not technology issues.&rdquo;<br /><br />Radio Flyer, the 92-year-old company famous for the little red wagon for children, has chosen Cloud Sites<sup>TM</sup>, to power the company&rsquo;s corporate site, RadioFlyer.com. Radio Flyer&rsquo;s decision to move the site to the highly scalable Cloud Sites platform was spurred by the company&rsquo;s future marketing initiatives to connect more creatively with customers through interactive online marketing activities which are intended to drive traffic to the site and support the future growth of the business.<br /><br />Radio Flyer initially tapped Rackspace to host its extranet for its sales representatives and career site, but has expanded its use of the solution to support its business strategy which will entail more interactive marketing to customers moving forward. The Radio Flyer website resides on Cloud Sites (from the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud portfolio</a>), a full-service cloud hosting platform which delivers automatic scaling to handle large usage spikes experienced by high-traffic, fast growth websites. With a large presence in the United States and 22 countries internationally, the Radio Flyer site needs to properly scale&mdash;especially during the busy summertime and holiday seasons.<br /><br />&ldquo;Key factors in our choice of Cloud Sites were the convenient and cost-effective pay-per-use model, load balancing, and high availability (HA) capabilities. As we migrated our corporate site, sales extranet and career site to The Rackspace Cloud, the ability of the service to support multiple platforms simultaneously was also a significant driver in our decision to move to Cloud Sites. We are able to run both our PHP and .net asp sites in parallel &ndash; eliminating the need for multiple web servers,&rdquo; said Cesario. &ldquo;In the coming months we are looking to integrate additional features to the Radio Flyer site that will potentially lead to significantly increased traffic. Incorporating The Rackspace Cloud into our business strategy gives us the assurance that the Radio Flyer site will not experience any downtime and that the other applications we incorporate into the site will be supported as well.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We are proud to support Radio Flyer, a household name, and a brand known for its high quality and hugely popular products. The Rackspace Cloud and Radio Flyer share two passions for our products: amazing reliability and a fun user experience,&rdquo; said Emil Sayegh, general manager, Rackspace Cloud. &ldquo;With Rackspace, RadioFlyer.com is backed with our award-winning <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support<sup>&reg;</sup></a>, and our 100% SLA guarantee for Cloud Sites, allowing them to solely concentrate on their customers, and on the famous little red wagon.&rdquo;</p>
