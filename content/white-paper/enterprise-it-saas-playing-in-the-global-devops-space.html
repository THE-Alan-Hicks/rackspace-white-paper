<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> Enable customer to scale their software in a cost- effective manner and maintain consistent, high levels of performance in a global marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>RACKSPACE<sup>®</sup> <strong>SOLUTION:</strong> <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/">Rackspace Managed Cloud Servers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/load-balancing">Load Balancers</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/mailgun">Mailgun</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> Greater efficiency and focus on application and product development resulting in exponential revenue growth; improved innovation in the enterprise IT SaaS space.</p>

<h3><strong><strong><strong>Rackspace solutions facilitate revenues while bolstering infrastructure from behind the scenes.</strong></strong></strong></h3>

<p>Founded in 2012, Plutora helps companies bring together enterprise IT processes and information. The Sydney, Australia-based SaaS provider helps its clients plan, manage and control complex IT releases and test environments in a simple and transparent manner.</p>

<p>“Our solution allows enterprises to manage complex releases as well as manage their inventory of test environments to effectively deliver on projects and releases,” said Sean Hamawi, Plutora Co-founder and Director. “We play in the enterprise DevOps space and manage tens of thousands of test environments for organizations around the world, spanning Fortune 1,000 to smaller software vendors.”</p>

<p>Plutora applications allow an organization to focus on running their internal processes, as opposed to having to manage their own on-premise solution.</p>

<p>“Part of the value of our solution is the flexibility to scale to meet our customer demands without actually impacting the way the customer works,” said Hamawi. “Rackspace has been a phenomenal partner because it allows us to focus on our growth, to focus on revenue-generating activities as opposed to focusing on infrastructure activities. Sometimes we say that behind the scenes Rackspace is so good, that we actually forget that they’re actually there.”</p>

<p><strong>Solving Global Challenges &amp; Choosing a Partner</strong></p>

<p>When the company began its journey, the co-founders studied how they would best manage Plutora infrastructure.</p>

<p>“We looked at all the tier one big players, Rackspace being one. Rackspace at the time was ahead of the game, and what we’re finding to date is Rackspace is still ahead of the game with a number of key features that they use, especially around the backups and monitoring.”</p>

<p>The decisive indicator was that Rackspace was going to be a fit for the global Plutora footprint. “When we first started our business, we were in development mode and we were predominantly based out of Rackspace starter servers in the U.S.,” said Hamawi. “As our business has grown the last 12 to 14 months, we have spun up new data centres using Rackspace in Sydney and in London, and we operate three different geographies using Rackspace as our backbone to effectively deliver our services and solutions.”</p>

<p><strong>Accelerating Success</strong></p>

<p>Plutora was built to address a number of key enterprise IT problems. To function at maximum effect, Plutora uses a number of Rackspace key product offerings, starting with R<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud">ackspace Managed Cloud</a> services across three different regions; USA, Sydney and in London. Plutora also uses <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/mailgun">Mailgun</a>, which at the moment is growing at least 50%, month on month.</p>

<p>Plutora participated in the <a href="http://rackspacestartups.com/">Rackspace Startup Program</a> — committed to helping entrepreneurs launch the next generation of businesses with our hosting, Fanatical Support<sup>®</sup>, mentorship and more. Hamawi affirms membership has led the company to new opportunities.</p>

<p>“One of the key benefits and the reason why we joined Rackspace was the ability to get into the program, and get off and running with infrastructure we needed immediately,” said Hamawi. “What’s more, out of blogs that were done through the program, we had a number of leads come through, customers inquiring, ‘If you’re using Rackspace, we’re interested to see what you guys are doing, what solutions you have.’ In fact, one of Australia’s most innovative online digital companies, contacted us through the program and have subsequently become a customer.”</p>

<p><strong>Confidently Delivering a Mission-Critical Application</strong></p>

<p>Plutora has received accolades throughout the world, most notably Gartner Cool Vender 2014 recognition, for innovation in the DevOps movement. “Today we are seeing an upcoming trend in DevOps. And what we want to do is focus on the enterprise DevOps layer, which is really around communication, planning and collaboration.”</p>

<p>Over the last 12 months, Plutora has experienced phenomenal growth. Revenue in the privately held company expanded by nearly 600%, and Plutora has hundreds of millions of releases under management in the Plutora platform.</p>

<p>According to Hamawi, using Rackspace, Plutora knows its solution will perform, and its people don’t need to worry about downtime. “Our customers use our platform seven days a week and practically 24 hours a day, he said. “Rackspace allows us to confidently deliver our mission-critical applications seven days a week.”</p>

<p>From day one, Plutora set out to build a SaaS organization focused on enterprise IT. The value proposition for our customers is enabling them to procure services quickly and inexpensively.</p>

<p>“Working with our Rackspace teams has been nothing short of phenomenal and the beauty about working with Rackspace teams is the support, which is second to none,” Hamawi said. “We have strong relationships with our counterparts in Sydney, in the U.S., and we’re slowly building up our relationships with the Rackspace team in the U.K.”</p>
