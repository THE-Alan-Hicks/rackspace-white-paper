<p><strong>CUSTOMER&rsquo;S BUSINESS:</strong> SmartBuyGlasses.com (a subsidiary of Motion Global Ltd.) is among the world&rsquo;s leading eyewear ecommerce retailers, offering the world&rsquo;s best branded designer sunglasses, prescription eyewear and contact lenses.</p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong> Position the firm&rsquo;s offerings for optimal ecommerce success during routine and peak demand and improve the customer experience worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>RACKSPACE</strong><strong>&reg; </strong><strong>SOLUTION: </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/">Rackspace Managed Cloud</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME: </strong>Ensure always-on, secure and scalable ecommerce performance, with support to solve ecommerce technical challenges and sustain a high-performance web presence that can scale rapidly during intense traffic spikes.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace helps the global eyewear specialist scale and increase sales.</strong></h3>
<p>SmartBuyGlasses.com competes in a value- and service-driven sector where uptime, customer experience, and responsive service are critical to success. Based in Shanghai, with facilities in Hong Kong and Italy, the popular eyewear e-tailer operates multiple sites in 15 languages, in more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our international development team [of 50] builds and manages an omni-channel commerce platform across ecommerce, mobile, interactive media, digital marketing, business intelligence, ERP, CRM and other web-integrated solutions,&rdquo; said Tony Zhuang, Co-founder of SmartBuyGlasses. com. &ldquo;Rackspace lets us deliver a service our customers demand, that is also scalable and cost-effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2008, Rackspace has been the foundation of the SmartBuyGlasses.com infrastructure. More recently, the Rackspace Managed Cloud solution has enabled the company to improve performance and security, boosting reliability during peak seasonal traffic.</p>
<p>With help from Rackspace, the organization also stays abreast of compliance and information security, and follows stringent external security standards, such as VeriSign SSL Secure. In addition, the company has a separate Test/Dev and Production environment hosted with Rackspace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see Rackspace as our strategic partner for long-term success, and chose Rackspace because the company&rsquo;s high service level and reliable global infrastructure met all our needs,&rdquo; said Zhuang. &ldquo;We host our B2C ecommerce platform and our internal CRM and ERP systems on Rackspace dedicated servers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Smart Growth Delivers with Increasing Customer Demand</strong></p>
<p>During recent holiday seasons, SmartBuyGlasses.com sites experienced the sort of peak volume which placed considerable strain on internally hosted infrastructure. To address this, the team approached Rackspace to address possible solutions to better handle the larger incoming site volume.</p>
<p>Zhuang points to SmartBuyGlasses.com&rsquo;s most recent holiday season performance outcome as the measure of success. &ldquo;Thanks in no small way to Rackspace &ndash; we achieved the business goal to double sales during the 2013 holiday season. During the holiday promotion, Rackspace dedicated servers maintained excellent uptime. Now we are working with Rackspace to find the best way of implementing Rackspace Managed Cloud to accommodate 2014 seasonal traffic spikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Managed Security, Fanatical Support</strong>&reg; <strong>Help Site Maintain Vision</strong></p>
<p>SmartBuyGlasses.com is no stranger to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/about/">Rackspace Fanatical Support</a>. For Rackspace, IT security means safeguarding data and preventing service interruption. &ldquo;Rackspace provides IT security products from Firewall and Anti-Virus to Managed Monitoring and Backup. We feel comfortable and safe to host our websites and systems under Rackspace safe umbrella.&rdquo; Said Zhuang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, Fanatical Support means any time we are building new servers or troubleshooting our servers, I can just pick up the phone.</p>
<p>We talk to our Rackspace account managers, implementation consultants and tech support team all the time on server upgrades, system settings or new technical solutions to optimize our server performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Future is so Bright</strong></p>
<p>To balance traffic globally, the company recently began using Rackspace Dedicated Hosting in Rackspace global data centers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With servers residing locally , it really helps a great deal in delivering high speed to our local customers,&rdquo; said Zhuang.</p>
<p>Based on the performance success delivered, SmartBuyGlasses.com plans to expand their relationship with Rackspace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flexibility of the Rackspace partnership helped our business growth in many ways during last six years,&rdquo; said Zhuang. &ldquo;We will use more dedicated servers in Rackspace global data centers with the further growth of our business. And we&rsquo;re looking into implementing the Dedicated Server + Rackspace Hybrid Cloud solution.&rdquo;</p>
