<p><strong>TCO vs. Total Value</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, organizations focus on total cost of ownership (TCO) when making IT decisions. How much it will cost and how much it will save. The bottom line cost savings of deploying on the cloud is usually enough to sell most businesses. And while discussing the less tangible <em>value</em> of the cloud is more difficult, this is often where the most meaningful impact is revealed.</p>

<p>TCO analysis typically consists of pure number crunching. The hardware for a server upgrade has a fixed price, as does the software license. It’s an important set of calculations in weighing options. For example, in a <a href="https://broadcast.rackspace.com/al/images/MV-Outsource-Infrastructure.pdf">recent white paper exploring TCO calculation</a>, a benchmark company was able to save over $3 million in first-year capital expenditure (CapEx) outlays alone.</p>

<p>But how do you put a price tag on time to market? Employee morale? Freeing up time for experimentation and innovation? Or deepening your current IT staff’s skills rather than hiring more personnel?</p>

<p>These benefits often trump the bare costs or savings involved with embracing the cloud. The hidden value of cloud adoption attached to these intangible benefits is largely dependent on your industry and organizational structure.</p>

<p>Raw cost analysis is generally the first step in determining whether or not a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/">managed cloud</a>—a solution where the vendor actively manages, patches and troubleshoots your cloud environment—is an effective way to solve the business problem at hand. This paper is intended to provide guidance once the raw cost analysis is complete. It can be used as a guide to discussing and documenting the total value of ownership (TVO) that the managed cloud can deliver.</p>

<p>We will discuss four areas and how they each demonstrate value for a business:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Competitive Advantage</li>
	<li>Time to Market</li>
	<li>Adaptability</li>
	<li>Employee Satisfaction</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“By 2015, </em><a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/2718918/cloud-computing-innovation-key-initiative#a1335578341"><em>according to Gartner research</em></a><em>, 50% of large global enterprises will rely on external cloud computing services for at least one of their top 10 revenue-generating </em><em>processes.” </em></p>

<p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></p>

<p>Often, businesses must choose between heavily financing one capability to the detriment of another. Market conditions, compliance mandates or IT budget limitations often set prioritization. However, organizations can quickly fall behind, spending their time playing catch up instead of innovating, without the tools to remain competitive. A managed cloud approach enables the business to spend time on the type of strategic work that moves the needle instead of just maintaining baseline operations.</p>

<p>For example, online retailers can use performance data, load time statistics and the impact of improved search rankings to justify customer experience improvements on a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/">managed ecommerce platform</a>. For each second of website latency, online visitors experience a 7% reduction in satisfaction, resulting in lower engagement and fewer conversions. So any move to a robust, managed cloud platform holds the potential to boost online satisfaction directly. Meanwhile, moving up in search rankings translates directly to more qualified leads and sales activity.</p>

<p><strong>Time to Market</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Whether getting a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product to market on time or deploying business critical applications like customer relationship management (CRM) software or email, time to market is often hampered by resource constraints that prevent completing a project on budget and on schedule. David Wills, General Manager of Platform Services at <a href="http://stories.rackspace.com/customers/xero/">Xero</a>, slashed hosting costs by 40 percent using the managed cloud. But Wills says the biggest benefit of the managed cloud is that Xero, “can spin up environments within 15 minutes now whereas previously it used take us over an hour.” <a href="http://stories.rackspace.com/customers/xero/">Wills credits</a> the ability to deploy hardware faster with the managed cloud as a key factor in getting Xero’s new features to market faster.</p>

<p>Clearly, managed cloud can save time—and cost—in procuring, testing and deploying cloud infrastructure. Spend time identifying other business-specific benefits you can gain by speeding up the time to market that may be more difficult to quantify, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How were sales disrupted by not getting the CRM deployed before the holiday rush?</li>
	<li>Are you missing opportunities because competitors have new functionality or features (online customization, chat, enhanced mobile experience) that you haven’t developed yet?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Can taking advantage of virtualization, automation and orchestration services shorten lead times on new software releases? &nbsp;</li>
	<li>What are the possible returns from automating processes like provisioning and alert response using DevOps methods? &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To ready the Prepara website for a flood of traffic, Marc Ensign of Sound-n-Vision relied on a managed cloud provider to handle scaling the site for the rush. “Managed cloud was an extremely cost-effective solution for us… Dedicated servers would have been 20 times the cost of using the cloud. And we got an even better result than we would have on dedicated because it was scalable. We could have added another 30 servers if we needed them,” </em><a href="http://stories.rackspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CRP-Prepara-Case-Study-Final.pdf"><em>explains Ensign</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Adaptability</strong></p>

<p>By encouraging experimentation, organizations gain the freedom to investigate new directions with minimal risk. One of the biggest impediments to innovation in many businesses is simply finding time for IT to plan and pilot projects along with the hardware and software resources to run it.</p>

<p>With demands on IT teams to do more with less, the value of chasing a new initiative is usually trumped by the mandate to keep the lights on. The increased flexibility of a managed cloud allows businesses to quickly react to market shifts while preparing for the demands of the future. It allows an organization to take a market-leader role instead of playing catch up.</p>

<p>Let’s consider an accounting team that’s been clamoring for a more tightly integrated billing and CRM system. For the level of complexity, system coordination and security requirements that must be managed, the integration requires something more customized and robust than a SaaS-based approach allows. The business needs to build a complete in-house solution.</p>

<p>If two system administrators weren’t tied up managing the bloated email server, they could be meeting with the accounting and sales teams, gathering requirements and investigating solutions. If the email servers were managed externally—with strict security and service level agreements (SLAs) in place—there would be more hardware and software resources on-site to help the accounting team innovate.</p>

<p>Additionally, with a managed cloud approach, the IT team is able to become more responsive and agile, reducing the chance of shadow IT and reinforcing the team’s role as a partner to the business. According to a recent study, combined increases in revenue and productivity due to similar gains in agility are as high as <a href="https://broadcast.rackspace.com/al/images/MV-Outsource-Infrastructure.pdf">$368,830</a> for a hypothetical financial services firm running approximately 40 servers over the course of a year.</p>

<p><em>Creating the framework to achieve efficiency gains may require skills that don’t currently exist in your organization or are hard to attain. For Dario De Santis, Product and Engineering Manager with </em><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-provider-nohold-answers-the-call-with-rackspace-managed-cloud/"><em>noHold, Inc.</em></a><em>, an AI-based virtual assistant provider, the managed cloud provides “</em><em>experts available to us to help us understand our environment, which empowers us to focus on our business and not on IT-related issues.” For noHold,</em><em> using managed cloud is a “</em><em>deal-enabler and arms us with the expertise to work with trusted global brands,” </em><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-provider-nohold-answers-the-call-with-rackspace-managed-cloud/"><em>says DeSantis</em></a><em>. &nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Employee Satisfaction </strong></p>

<p>When adopting the cloud, new competencies may need to be developed within your organization or attained from outside experts. Your email administrator may become a messaging architect, your web developer may transform into a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/">Magento</a> platform-certified technician. Embrace this change by offering employees training to gain new skills. Recently developed expertise, higher salaries and more job security, employees are less likely to leave. Employees who are learning and growing in their roles are usually happier over the long term.</p>

<p>Tedious chores like complex upgrades, migrations, patches and bug fixes suck time and energy out of the IT team. Managed cloud lets these professionals focus on higher-value projects that drive innovation.</p>

<p>Managed cloud providers have multiple teams of top quality, experienced certified IT professionals across a range of disciplines like Red Hat, Cisco, Microsoft, and so on. Tapping into the economy of expertise available from a managed cloud provider means getting the expert you need, when you need them, without adding headcount.</p>

<p><strong><em>Responding to Security Threats With Managed Cloud</em></strong></p>

<p><em>When vulnerabilities were discovered in Bash (known as the Bash bug or Shellshock), found in most versions of Unix, Linux and Mac OSX operating systems, the security implications had IT teams scrambling to apply patches and run security scans. </em></p>

<p><em>Managed cloud customers, on the other hand, were patched and secured without the need for customers to drop what they were doing to react accordingly. </em></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Extending a team with the managed cloud allows a business to balance out needs and add the capacity, functionality and expertise required to stay viable in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Uncovering the total value of ownership is just as important as calculating raw cost savings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to simple cost analysis, companies should focus on the value gained from competitive advantage, time to market, adaptability and employee satisfaction. This will give your stakeholders the most complete picture of what to expect, allowing for better-informed decisions.</p>
