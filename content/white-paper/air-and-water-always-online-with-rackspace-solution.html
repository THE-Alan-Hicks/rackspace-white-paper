The company Peters founded, Air &amp; Water, Inc. (<a href="http://www.air-n-water.com/">www.Air-N-Water.com</a>), began with a modest line of air conditioners. Today, it is one of the Internet&rsquo;s largest independent appliance retailers, with a full catalog of residential heating and cooling systems, purification products and home appliances.<br /><br />Peters attributes his company&rsquo;s success to a combination of factors. One is consumers&rsquo; increased willingness to purchase household items from online storefronts. Another is the company&rsquo;s strategic decision to expand its catalog to include products like wine coolers.<br /><br />But equally important is Air &amp; Water&rsquo;s commit- ment to website reliability&mdash;something it achieved by hosting its servers with Rackspace.</p><h3>NOT A SINGLE UNPLANNED OUTAGE</h3><p>Air &amp; Water wasn&rsquo;t always a Rackspace customer. When it first opened its cyber doors in 2002, it ran its website on an in-house server. The server ran fine, but there were chronic issues with its T1 line. &ldquo;Our T1 was really unreliable,&rdquo; says Adam Hart, IT Manager, Air &amp; Water. &ldquo;We kept getting knocked offline for an hour or more at a time. And for an e-commerce company, that is death.&rdquo;<br /><br />To make matters worse, the line was owned by one company but leased to another. As a result, it was never entirely clear which vendor should be held accountable for the service&rsquo;s recurring connectivity issues. &ldquo;It seemed like we could never get a straight answer about what was going on,&rdquo; Hart says. &ldquo;This was a mission critical piece of our business, and I never felt comfortable with the quality of support we were getting. It was frustrating.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was an unsustainable situation. As an e-commerce company, Air &amp; Water depends on its web applications for the vast majority of its sales transactions. And during peaks in its sales cycles&mdash;when seasonal changes in the weather spark demand for air conditioners or portable heaters, for instance&mdash;the company processes thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of business every hour.<br /><br />So Air &amp; Water began looking at managed hosting. &ldquo;We knew we were going to need more bandwidth anyway,&rdquo; Hart says. &ldquo;We were also outgrowing our server. So rather than buying all new hardware and adding another T1 line, we decided to outsource.&rdquo;<br /><br />The company considered a number of managed hosting providers. It quickly realized that Rackspace was the strongest contender. &ldquo;We wanted to go with an established company,&rdquo; Hart says. &ldquo;With Rackspace, we knew we had a hosting provider that will be around for the long term.&rdquo;<br /><br />Moving its <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/saas/">web applications</a> to a Rackspace environment resulted in an immediate improvement in Air &amp; Water&rsquo;s website availability. &ldquo;We have not had a single unplanned outage since we moved to Rackspace,&rdquo; Hart notes. &ldquo;Our website is now up and running around the clock.&rdquo;</p><h3>FANATICAL SUPPORT DELIVERS PEACE OF MIND</h3><p>The reliable hardware and connectivity delivered by Rackspace hosting certainly solved Air &amp; Water&rsquo;s most critical business requirement. But the company&rsquo;s relationship with Rackspace has delivered other benefits as well.<br /><br />Rackspace monitors Air &amp; Water&rsquo;s website, for example, pinging it every five minutes to make sure it is up. &ldquo;I no longer have to worry about the server going down in the middle of the night,&rdquo; Hart says. &ldquo;We have around-the-clock monitoring without the expense of having someone on staff to watch our site 24 x 7.&rdquo;<br /><br />When Air &amp; Water added another server to its infrastructure, Hart adds, &ldquo;Rackspace helped us upgrade while staying within our budget. It&rsquo;s another way their customer service has been amazing.&rdquo;<br /><br />And any time Hart has had specific technical questions, Rackspace has proved to be an invaluable resource. &ldquo;The Rackspace support team goes above and beyond anything I&rsquo;d expect,&rdquo; Hart says. &ldquo;They advertise that they offer <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support</a>, and they do.&rdquo;<br /><br />As the Air &amp; Water CEO, Peters also cites Rackspace support as one of the key benefits of the company&rsquo;s relationship. &ldquo;Rackspace Fanatical Support gives me peace of mind,&rdquo; Peters says. &ldquo;I know that if we ever experience an issue, Rackspace will be right there to fix it. As a business owner, that is exactly what I was looking for&mdash;and with Rackspace, it&rsquo;s what we got.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p><div>&nbsp;</div>
