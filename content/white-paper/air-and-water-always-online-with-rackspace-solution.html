The company Peters founded, Air &amp; Water, Inc. (<a href="http://www.air-n-water.com/">www.Air-N-Water.com</a>), began with a modest line of air conditioners. Today, it is one of the Internet’s largest independent appliance retailers, with a full catalog of residential heating and cooling systems, purification products and home appliances.<br /><br />Peters attributes his company’s success to a combination of factors. One is consumers’ increased willingness to purchase household items from online storefronts. Another is the company’s strategic decision to expand its catalog to include products like wine coolers.<br /><br />But equally important is Air &amp; Water’s commit- ment to website reliability—something it achieved by hosting its servers with Rackspace.</p><h3>NOT A SINGLE UNPLANNED OUTAGE</h3><p>Air &amp; Water wasn’t always a Rackspace customer. When it first opened its cyber doors in 2002, it ran its website on an in-house server. The server ran fine, but there were chronic issues with its T1 line. “Our T1 was really unreliable,” says Adam Hart, IT Manager, Air &amp; Water. “We kept getting knocked offline for an hour or more at a time. And for an e-commerce company, that is death.”<br /><br />To make matters worse, the line was owned by one company but leased to another. As a result, it was never entirely clear which vendor should be held accountable for the service’s recurring connectivity issues. “It seemed like we could never get a straight answer about what was going on,” Hart says. “This was a mission critical piece of our business, and I never felt comfortable with the quality of support we were getting. It was frustrating.”<br /><br />It was an unsustainable situation. As an e-commerce company, Air &amp; Water depends on its web applications for the vast majority of its sales transactions. And during peaks in its sales cycles—when seasonal changes in the weather spark demand for air conditioners or portable heaters, for instance—the company processes thousands of dollars’ worth of business every hour.<br /><br />So Air &amp; Water began looking at managed hosting. “We knew we were going to need more bandwidth anyway,” Hart says. “We were also outgrowing our server. So rather than buying all new hardware and adding another T1 line, we decided to outsource.”<br /><br />The company considered a number of managed hosting providers. It quickly realized that Rackspace was the strongest contender. “We wanted to go with an established company,” Hart says. “With Rackspace, we knew we had a hosting provider that will be around for the long term.”<br /><br />Moving its <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/enterprise_hosting/saas/">web applications</a> to a Rackspace environment resulted in an immediate improvement in Air &amp; Water’s website availability. “We have not had a single unplanned outage since we moved to Rackspace,” Hart notes. “Our website is now up and running around the clock.”</p><h3>FANATICAL SUPPORT DELIVERS PEACE OF MIND</h3><p>The reliable hardware and connectivity delivered by Rackspace hosting certainly solved Air &amp; Water’s most critical business requirement. But the company’s relationship with Rackspace has delivered other benefits as well.<br /><br />Rackspace monitors Air &amp; Water’s website, for example, pinging it every five minutes to make sure it is up. “I no longer have to worry about the server going down in the middle of the night,” Hart says. “We have around-the-clock monitoring without the expense of having someone on staff to watch our site 24 x 7.”<br /><br />When Air &amp; Water added another server to its infrastructure, Hart adds, “Rackspace helped us upgrade while staying within our budget. It’s another way their customer service has been amazing.”<br /><br />And any time Hart has had specific technical questions, Rackspace has proved to be an invaluable resource. “The Rackspace support team goes above and beyond anything I’d expect,” Hart says. “They advertise that they offer <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/">Fanatical Support</a>, and they do.”<br /><br />As the Air &amp; Water CEO, Peters also cites Rackspace support as one of the key benefits of the company’s relationship. “Rackspace Fanatical Support gives me peace of mind,” Peters says. “I know that if we ever experience an issue, Rackspace will be right there to fix it. As a business owner, that is exactly what I was looking for—and with Rackspace, it’s what we got.”<br /><br /></p><div>&nbsp;</div>
