<p><strong>RACKSPACE</strong>® <strong>SOLUTION:  </strong><a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-cloud/">Managed Cloud Hosting</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed-hosting/dedicated-servers/">Dedicated Hosting</a></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME:</strong> The sixteen year partnership with Rackspace has enabled Shaadi.com to grow exponentially, accommodating over 30 million members, managing over 200 million page views per month and over 10,000 registrations daily.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace supports IT infrastructure and website on a managed cloud platform.</strong></h3>
<p>Shaadi.com is the world’s largest matrimonial service, which has also been recognized as the “Most Innovative Company in India of 2011” by Fast Company, USA—one of the worlds leading progressive business media brands. Due to continuous innovation and the development of a user-friendly interface, Shaadi.com was ranked “39 Globally Amongst the 50 Most Innovative Companies” by Fast Company.</p>
<p>The matrimonial business is growing rapidly in India, as matrimony sites are transforming the Indian marriage system and creating the ‘Internet Marriage’ era. People Interactive, the consumer arm of the People Group, owns the matrimonial portal Shaadi.com along with real estate site Makaan.com and friendship and social networking service Fropper.com.</p>
<p><strong>Building a Premium Online Experience</strong></p>
<p>In 1998, Shaadi.com saw an opportunity to build the world’s largest online matrimonial site. At the time, online dating and networking was non-existent; however, marriage and finding a good match remained a core value. Shaadi.com set out to create an online experience that matched or heightened the traditional dating and social networking experience in India. But before it did, it needed to find the right IT partner to help them meet this goal.</p>
<p>“As a startup and an online startup for that matter, it was important to find a technology partner that allowed us to keep IT costs to a minimum, while also providing the right IT infrastructure to meet our growing needs,” explains Anand Mittal, COO &amp; Director, Shaadi.com. “We needed to find a partner that could help us build a premium online experience for our customers—one that could accommodate millions of customers and scale as demand grew.”</p>
<p>What was also important for Shaadi.com was to find a partner with a good service level agreement (SLA), as availability and reliability of its website was critical for building a successful business.</p>
<p>“Rackspace was an easy and clear choice for us, as Rackspace provided an industry- leading SLA—one built on the importance of website availability, uptime and support. Of all the potential partners who we met with during our search for an IT partner, Rackspace value proposition and focus on support was unprecedented—a partnership that we couldn’t walk away from,” said Mittal. “On top of this, Rackspace provided 24x7x365 <strong>Fanatical Support</strong><strong>®</strong>, meaning on-call specialists are available to help and advise at any time, day or night.”</p>
<p><strong>Managed Infrastructure Enables Rapid Growth</strong></p>
<p>Beginning with one Rackspace server in 1998, the company has grown exponentially since its initial deployment with Rackspace. Today, 30 million people use Shaadi.com, 3.2 million members have found their matches through the site, and the company has built over 100 matchmaking centres across 87 cities in India.</p>
<p>“Since day one, Rackspace dedicated hosting and Managed Cloud computing services have been a critical component to the growth and success of our business,” said Mittal. “Any downtime of our website is detrimental to our business, as it impacts our brand image and damages customer loyalty. To be successful and gain the trust of our customers, we consistently need to deliver a seamless experience and make sure they are happy. Rackspace enables us to do that.”</p>
<p>In addition to uptime guarantees, Rackspace dedicated infrastructure for managing day-to-day traffic has enabled Shaadi.com to effectively manage traffic spikes during growth spurts and peak traffic times. Today, Shaadi.com effectively manages over 200 million page views per month and over 10,000 registrations on Shaadi.com daily. It has been voted as the site with the most visitors amongst matrimonial sites by Compete Snapshot and among the Top Ten most visited websites in India by Alexa.</p>
<p>“As more people around the world get access to the Internet, the more people we have coming to our site—and we don’t see this stopping any time soon. With Rackspace, we’re able to rapidly scale as demand increases, while also continuing to ensure the site is always available and customers have access to the content quickly,” said Mittal.</p>
<p><strong>The Power of Support</strong></p>
<p>While reliability and scalability initially attracted Shaadi.com to Rackspace, Fanatical Support is what has made the company a satisfied customer for almost two decades.</p>
<p>“Rackspace real-time and round-the-clock IT expertise and relentless customer support has been critical to the success of our business,” said Mittal. “With the team in place, we can focus on our core business as opposed to dealing with server and network problems.”</p>
<p>“The recognition that we’ve received within the industry has been humbling and rewarding,” concludes Mittal. “However, we couldn’t have gotten these awards without the support of Rackspace. As we continue to grow and expand around the globe, we look forward to extending our partnership with Rackspace.”</p>
