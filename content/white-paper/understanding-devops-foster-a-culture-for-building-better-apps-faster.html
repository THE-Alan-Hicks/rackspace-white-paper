<h2>The new world of DevOps</h2>

<p>DevOps isn't just another IT buzzword. DevOps is here to stay. According to our 2014 DevOps Adoption report (conducted by Vanson Bourne, a technology research firm, and commissioned by Rackspace), the vast majority of surveyed businesses have either already implemented DevOps practices (51 percent of respondents) or were planning to implement them (35 percent of respondents).</p>

<p>At Rackspace, we help many different companies succeed in their DevOps journey. In this paper, we review what DevOps is and how it challenges prevailing IT processes, organizational structures and cultural expectations. Then we dive deeper into the primary aspects of DevOps and how to get them right.</p>

<h3>What does DevOps really mean?</h3>

<p>DevOps is an emerging trend that continues to evolve, so definitions vary. But here's what it means to us at Rackspace:</p>

<p>DevOps is a combination of culture, processes, and technologies that empower software development and IT operations teams to work closely together to enable the fastest time-to-market and maximum business agility.</p>

<p>If you're a developer, that might sound like business jargon. But most practitioners and analysts agree with us on a few key points. In short, DevOps is about:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Breaking down silos, especially between developers and ops engineers</li>
	<li>Automating infrastructure wherever it makes sense</li>
	<li>Shipping high-quality code fast through processes like continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), usually facilitated by the cloud</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Why should I care about DevOps?</h3>

<p>Our DevOps Adoption report reveals that most surveyed businesses using DevOps are already realizing a wide range of real, measurable benefits as a direct result of implementing DevOps practices.</p>

<p>Technical benefits include faster delivery of new features (for 57 percent of respondents), more stable operating environments (46 percent) and reduced application downtime (44 percent). In turn, these have led directly to successful business outcomes such as improved customer satisfaction (for 52 percent of respondents) and reduced IT infrastructure spend (49 percent).</p>

<p><a id="old"> </a></p>

<h2>The old IT - Siloed and slow</h2>

<p>To successfully implement DevOps practices and technologies, you first need to understand how the DevOps trend currently challenges the way most IT departments have functioned for many decades.</p>

<p>Despite the large percentage of surveyed organizations that have already begun or are planning to start their DevOps journey, the IT function in most enterprises looks like this:</p>

<table border="1">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>DEVELOPMENT (Dev)</th>
			<th>QUALITY TESTING</th>
			<th>OPERATIONS (Ops)</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Silo 1:</strong> Develop</td>
			<td><strong>Silo 2:</strong> Test</td>
			<td><strong>Silo 3:</strong> Deploy</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Who:</strong> Developers</td>
			<td><strong>Who:</strong> Testers /QA Analysts</td>
			<td><strong>Who:</strong> Sys admins, DBAs and network admins</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>What:</strong> Writing code for new applications, customizations to licensed applications or new versions of existing applications</td>
			<td><strong>What:</strong> Making sure applications are fit for purpose before being released to production, and reporting bugs back to developers for fixing</td>
			<td><strong>What:</strong> Provisioning and managing servers to run applications, monitoring performance, fixing problems and system bottlenecks</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>This means four things for the application development and deployment process:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>It's siloed</strong> - The functions often don't sit in the same building. Sometimes they're even in different time zones, and day-to-day collaboration is minimal.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>It's linear -</strong> One job starts when another finishes. QA starts when the dev team hands over a release for testing. Operations start when a completed app is released for production.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>It's manual</strong> - Lots of human effort is required at every stage, from writing and testing the code to installing and provisioning servers.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>It's slow</strong> - It can take months to get a new application or new functionality in front of users. Inflexible deployment cycles and sluggish time-to-market make it hard to create a competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The prevalence of the cloud has transformed this traditional approach to developing, testing, and deploying software.</p>

<p><a id="new"> </a></p>

<h2>The new DevOps plus cloud</h2>

<p>To take advantage of the cloud's improved speed and flexibility, development and operations teams need to work together more closely and productively. That's where DevOps comes in. But change is always hard. Building a DevOps culture means using the following principles, referred to collectively as CAMS:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Collaborate - </strong> Create an environment where dev and ops teams can work towards common business objectives that are set at the top levels of the business. This can involve everything from physically moving teams to be near each other to finding good collaboration tools, agreeing on a common language and even organizing social events.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Automate -</strong> Remove any manual processes that can slow down the continuous delivery model.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Measure -</strong> Identify metrics and continuously measure success (and failure) to learn what works and what to avoid.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Share -</strong> Feed results back to everyone who can use them productively.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>When we work with our enterprise customers to help them improve DevOps processes, we apply the CAMS principles to four areas of their business:</p>

<ol>
	<li>People<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Applications<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Services<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Technology<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>The information in this article addresses each of these areas and provide tips for creating a DevOps culture in your organization.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a><br />
<br /></p>
<p><a id="ppl"> </a></p>

<h2>Creating a DevOps culture</h2>

<p>For organizations that run the siloed model, moving to DevOps requires a radical change in thinking, culture, and approach. Although dev and ops engineers are probably already breaking down walls and collaborating informally, for DevOps to become part of organizational culture, the change needs to be driven from the top.</p>

<h3>What do we mean by <em>the top</em>?</h3>

<p>Usually <em>the top</em> the person who has ultimate accountability for both software development and IT operations. That role might be different in different organizations: It could be the CIO, the CTO, or the COO. In technology-driven businesses, like ecommerce companies it could even be the CEO.</p>

<h3>Enable DevOps</h3>

<p>To enable DevOps, it is critical that key stakeholders:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Understand that a DevOps approach can transform agility and competitiveness</li>
	<li>Convince non-IT senior management of the need for DevOps</li>
	<li>Know what has to be done to make the change happen</li>
	<li>Implement and lead a plan for transition (or identify someone to do it)</li>
	<li>Motivate everyone to get on board with the plan</li>
	<li>Measure and report on the success of the DevOps transition on an ongoing basis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building aplications for the cloud</h2>

<p>To reap the full benefit of the cloud, applications need to be architected from the ground up of the cloud environment. Although some legacy applications can be ported to the cloud, cloud-native applications can best exploit the cloud's speed and agility. In a DevOps environment, that means ensuring dev and ops teams can work together to accomplish the following tasks:</p>

<h3>Build for scale</h3>

<p>Ensure that everyone has a good understanding of the underlying cloud platform, so devs can build apps and components that are capable of scaling instantly and effortlessly.</p>

<h3>Build for fail</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental aspects of the cloud is that it's built on hundreds or thousands of low-cost commodity servers, so it's not uncommon for an individual node to fail. The key is to architect cloud applications to glide effortlessly over localized failure without the user noticing anything.</p>

<h3>Automate everything</h3>

<p>The more the development and deployment process can be automated, the faster and smoother it will be. DevOps teams should try to automate as much as possible, so that traditional bottlenecks (like the days it used to take to provision a new server) disappear.</p>

<h3>Reduce costs</h3>

<p>When dev and ops teams work together more efficiently and automate time-consuming processes, a natural outcome is lower transactional costs. Additionally, after scale is achieved, costs remain the same, while users increase dramatically.</p>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a><br />
<br /><p>
<p><a id="agi"> </a></p>

<h2>Agility - Componentize everything</h2>

<p>When you're working in the cloud and something goes wrong, you need to be able to fix it as quickly and as easily as possible. The key is to approach everything in a modular fashion, so you need to fix or replace only the faulty component rather than the whole system. This enables you to keep moving at cloud speed, which means improving time-to-market, without obstacles dragging down the rate of innovation. We call this principle <strong>componentize everything</strong>, and it applies at all levels of the cloud. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Application development -</strong> Build and release applications in small, discrete chunks for rapid iteration, testing, and deployment. If one part of an app fails, you need to rewrite only that part. CI and CD allow teams to quickly verify builds, identify bugs, and deploy production-ready software.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud infrastructure -</strong> Build clouds from many, low-cost hardware components. If one fails, then the system works around it and the faulty node can be replaced.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Cloud services - </strong> From infrastructure providers to cloud tool vendors, ensure that you can easily swap vendor services in and out, so you aren't held back by contracts that no longer meet your needs.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="tec"> </a></p>

<h2>Using the right tools for the job</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, automating time-consuming software deployment and infrastructure management tasks is an important step toward achieving DevOps goals like improved time-to-market. You need to choose the right tools and gain access to the skills that you need to maintain and use them effectively.</p>

<h3>Which tools to use</h3>

<p>The tools that you use depend on your stack, your current in-house skills, and your team's preferences. For example, one of the most important choices you make might be whether to use Chef or Windows PowerShell DSC for configuration management. If you're running a Windows stack and using .NET, Windows DSC might be a better fit. If you're running a Linux stack, you may want to use Chef. The tool that you choose depends on your particular situation.</p>

<p>To get these critical technology decisions right from the beginning, it's important to rely on engineers experienced with DevOps processes and infrastructure automation. Most businesses choose a combination of the following three options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allocate current dev and ops resources to learn these tools.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Hire new talent (ideally with real-world experience).<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Leverage a managed services provider with deep DevOps experience.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Every organization is different, and choosing the right tools depends on a wide range of factors. But to get you started, here is a basic introduction to some of the DevOps tools we use to help our customers.</p>

<h2>Boost capacity and expertise with Managed Services</h2>

<p>Here's another key question when you're planning your DevOps initiative: To what extent will your business leverage managed DevOps service providers to bolster your operations team and deliver guidance around new processes, tools, and culture challenges?</p>

<p>According to the Rackspace-commissioned DevOps Adoption report, a significant majority of surveyed organizations currently using DevOps practices (70 percent) choose to work with managed DevOps service providers like Rackspace. Why do so many turn to external expertise?</p>

<p>It's more economical. Improved cost efficiency was the most commonly cited reason for using managed DevOps services (59 percent of respondents). By leveraging a trusted service provider, businesses gain access to expert DevOps engineers and developers as a support function to their team without the expense of hiring, training, developing, and retaining highly sought-after talent.</p>

<p>It frees devs to write code. Half of businesses relying on managed DevOps services (50 percent of respondents) say that relying on an external partner <q>allows them to focus on innovation.</q> A managed hosting provider like Rackspace can handle the management of customers' DevOps tools like PowerShell DSC, as well as their infrastructure (maintenance, patching, monitoring, and so on).</p>

<p>Although it's still important for developers in a DevOps organization to communicate closely with their provider and think carefully about how their code will be deployed, these managed services address one of the most common criticisms of DevOps, it can distract developers from doing what they do best &amp;151; writing high-quality code.</p>

<h2>Quick quiz</h2>

<p>The following questions can help you assess how ready your organization is for DevOps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where in the hierarchy does accountability for dev and ops meet?</li>
	<li>Are there release-frequency-based goals and objectives in performance criteria?</li>
	<li>How frequently are you able to release code to production?</li>
	<li>How often do dev and ops teams speak?</li>
	<li>Are customers starting to demand faster and better service from you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following resources to help you with your decision:</p>

<h2>Realizing the promise of DevOps</h2>

<p>The cloud is all about being able to move (and learn, adapt and evolve) faster than your competitors. DevOps isn't a prerequisite for taking advantage of cloud. You can still gain immense cost, efficiency, and agility benefits from the cloud without reorganizing for DevOps.</p>

<p>But when you create a culture in which every layer of your organization, from people to technology infrastructure can work at cloud speed, with no barriers, miscommunication or bottlenecks, nothing can slow you down.</p>
