<p><strong>BUSINESS OUTCOME</strong>: Rackspace has helped speed the WePay solution and scale its infrastructure, improving the productivity of its developers, enabling the company to deliver more consistent, faster payment security and support.</p>
<h3><strong>Rackspace allows specialized payment solution platform to scale quickly.</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 2008, Palo Alto-based WePay is a flexible online payments API. Designed for crowdfunding, marketplaces and software for small businesses, the fast-growing company offers users a seamless experience and fraud protection, allowing customers to access WePay payment capabilities as well as process credit cards.</p>
<p>”Our customers are trying to charge a buyer and pay a seller, and complexities abound when it comes to facilitating payment,” explains Bill Clerico, WePay Founder and CEO. “Thousands of developers that have come and built on our platform, which facilitates an entire transaction, underwriting the risk. And it’s really unique value for that type of business.”</p>
<p>The typical WePay customer is a developer building a marketplace (think of Uber, Etsy or AirBNB), a crowdfunding site such as Gofundme or Kickstarter, or a small business software platform for invoicing or cloud accounting.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Challenges Head on with Rackspace</strong></p>
<p>Because the rapidly growing company processes thousands of transactions and hundreds of millions of dollars per year, it chose Rackspace and DevOps to help it build a robust backend. “I’ve known Rackspace for a long time, and we had worked together at a pretty small capacity to host internal servers,” Clerico says. “As the cloud advanced and as different solutions advanced, we decided to take advantage of these Rackspace capabilities to help our growth.”</p>
<p>“In the span of just three months, we doubled our transaction volume, which put a huge load on our servers,” Clerico says, describing the sort of expansion that also entails surges in transactions per second, fraud analyses and increasing customer expectations of uptime, availability and response.</p>
<p>Consulting with Rackspace experts, WePay began using a combination of services, including dedicated storage, managed hardware and cloud services.&nbsp;"We had to scale infrastructure quickly,” Clerico says. “It would have been hard to do a lot of the things we needed with just the team we had internally, nor could we build our team fast enough, and that is one of the reasons we chose Rackspace to help us grow.”</p>
<p><strong>DevOps Automation Service from Rackspace</strong></p>
<p>“Security issues make payments unique in that you can’t just use default cloud hosting providers,” Clerico says. “Likewise, managing a full data center is time consuming. You don’t necessarily want to have raw hardware for everything; you want that hybrid, cloud hardware approach. We see the value of a managed cloud infrastructure to help us navigate all of the above for our users.”</p>
<p>To allow WePay developers a more worry-free development and deployment environment, the DevOps Automation Service from Rackspace is now helping WePay’s development team rapidly expand its development infrastructure without taking on more systems management tasks.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons we chose Rackspace was speed to get live assistance around DevOps,” Clerico says. “Previously we’d manage individual servers manually, but now the configuration is entirely automated through Chef script. It’s something we always wanted to do but never set aside time to get done, and it was great that we were able to lean on the folks at Rackspace to help us get it running faster.”</p>
<p>“We were able to spin out a new data center in Rackspace in the time that it would have taken to add a couple of boxes to our old setup,” Clerico said of the service, which lets developers take advantage of agile tools and processes to help speed and continuously deliver features to market.</p>
<p>As WePay grows, building multiple data centers and adding infrastructure, Clerico says that all signs are positive. “Over the next five to ten years there’s going to be a huge shift away from traditional ecommerce to this distributed, connected, collaborative commerce,” concludes Clerico. “I’m looking forward to investing in the Rackspace relationship.”</p>
