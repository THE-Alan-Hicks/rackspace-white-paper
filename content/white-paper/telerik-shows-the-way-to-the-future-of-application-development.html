<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Design industry-leading application development solutions, addressing open modular development stack and mobile platform at the enterprise level.</p>

<p><strong>Rackspace<sup>®</sup> Solution:</strong> <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private">Rackspace Private Cloud</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/managed_colocation">Managed Colocation</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/hybrid/rackconnect">RackConnect<sup>®</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Business Outcome:</strong> Up to a 40-percent reduction in cost, achieved through the ability to provision on-demand and to speed deployment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Relying on Rackspace, Telerik takes its place as an app innovation leader worldwide.</em></strong></p>

<p>Dedicated to accelerating productivity and improving creativity among its developer clientele, Telerik enables users to build compelling apps suited to all platforms. Founded in 2002 and now a division of Massachusetts-based Progress Software Corporation, the company combines industry-leading UI tools with cloud services to simplify and shorten development time. Telerik serves 90% of the Fortune 500 and more than 60,000 organizations worldwide including NASA, Microsoft, VistaPrint, CBRE, the UK Parliament — as well as academic institutions, governments and more.</p>

<p>Maintaining a leadership position requires a specific infrastructure composed of dedicated, private and public cloud hosting solutions — using the advantages of each to build a solution that perfectly meets the needs of Telerik and its developers. To achieve this, Telerik works with Rackspace.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering Enterprise-Level Hybrid Services</strong></p>

<p>It’s no small feat to incorporate private and public cloud, dedicated networking, colocation, and intensive service offerings — all while ensuring users the freedom to maintain high levels of internal control. But the decision-makers at Telerik were confident that Rackspace could address the challenge of delivering a made-to-order, hybrid set of services to meet its needs.</p>

<p>Telerik is also a huge supporter of the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack">OpenStack<sup>®</sup> community</a>. The company has invested heavily in OpenStack, and hosts its own local user groups. Telerik believes strongly, as Rackspace does, that OpenStack is the leading facilitator of cloud innovation. This is another reason why Rackspace was the obvious choice for Telerik.</p>

<p>“We have worked with Rackspace for a while, we know each other well and we are confident they are the right service provider for us,” said Simeon Stoychev, Chief Information Officer at Telerik. “But more than that, as OpenStack is key to our success, working with one of the founders was an obvious benefit.”</p>

<p><strong>Linking Growth And Continued Success</strong></p>

<p>Making the lives of developers easier means finding the right balance between high security, control, flexibility and simplicity. Their work processes must become faster, more efficient, more reliable and cost-effective. RackConnect spans the entire Telerik infrastructure, seamlessly linking private, public and dedicated resources.</p>

<p>By combining dedicated networking and public cloud scalability, Telerik and Rackspace are able to speed the deployment of resources and achieve on-demand provisioning. Users gain increased agility, greater levels of control and customization, and the security afforded by the private cloud.</p>

<p>“By handpicking the best of Rackspace and combining it as one platform, we break down technical barriers and achieve the improved performance we were looking for,” said Stoychev. Automation was also a key requirement, he said. “We are now able to automatically configure every aspect of our infrastructure. By combining a mixture of services, we have not only improved our offering but have also generated real costs savings.”</p>

<p>Telerik was recently named as a “Visionary” in the 2014 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms and it plans to build on its success by expanding its global footprint.</p>

<p>“By investing in OpenStack and working with Rackspace, we can easily expand our global footprint,” Stoychev explains. “We have all of our workloads set up in the way that we need them and in the way that works best for our clients. We have a model that can be easily replicated as we expand into new territories.”</p>
