<p>Based on deep expertise of Magento deployments, this white paper provides guidance and reference architecture for building word-class ecommerce websites on the Magento platform.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Whether you are launching your first online store on Magento’s ecommerce platform or you are re-architecting it with Magento Enterprise, you need a cloud or hybrid partner that is seasoned in hosting Magento platforms to build secure, scalable and highly available online stores.</p>

<p>With Rackspace, you are in the hands of a proven <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/">Magento Hosting Partner</a> dthat has helped more than 1,000 customers globally, ranging from SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. According to a study from ecommerce publishing authority Internet Retailer, Rackspace is currently ranked the number one hosting provider for the Internet Retailer Top 1,000 websites. Rackspace now hosts <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Magento">a greater percentage of the world's Magento deployments than any other hosting provider</a>. In order to support you as a team, Rackspace has entered into the Magento Hosting Partner program as a Platinum level partner.</p>

<p>“Rackspace ecommerce hosting solutions for Magento,” here after referred as “the solution,” is a <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/">Magento ecommerce platform optimized by Rackspace Hosting</a>. This solution is a combination of multiple product offerings from Rackspace including dedicated hosting, cloud hosting, hybrid hosting and additional services meant to augment performance.</p>

<h3>2. Use Cases</h3>

<p>Ecommerce commonly refers to the buying and selling process of various products and services through the online environment. Ecommerce websites are in most cases well designed websites with high amounts of traffic, while ecommerce hosting enables ecommerce websites to be hosted on shared or dedicated server hardware. Rackspace ecommerce hosting for Magento supports the following most common ecommerce hosting use cases:
<ol>
	<li><strong>100% Uptime</strong> &ndash; When your website is your cash register, it has to be open for business — always. Thus, ecommerce websites are required to be highly available. The solution can guarantee 100% production uptime, provided a recommended topology is deployed.</li>
	<li><strong>Page Load Times Less Than Two Seconds</strong> &ndash; Loading ecommerce web pages within two seconds, even during peak load time, is an industry norm. The solution supports faster page loads.</li>
	<li><strong>Security of Sensitive Data</strong> &ndash; Ecommerce sites requires very secure infrastructure for managing sensitive data on the server collected from the users of the website, including credit card information. The solution helps customers in PCI compliance using PCI compliant dedicated infrastructure and third party payment gateways for cloud infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Scalability</strong> &ndash; The ability to handle sudden and/or seasonal spikes in demand for holiday seasons is the most important use case for ecommerce websites. The solution supports this use case using cloud infrastructure to make your infrastructure feel virtually unlimited.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><strong>In summary, we help merchants architect and deploy secure, scalable and highly available Magento ecommerce stores on Rackspace Infrastructure.</strong></p>

<h3>3. Factors Influencing Solution Design</h3>

<p>Various factors influence your choice of hardware for your online ecommerce store. Some of the most important factors to consider include:<br />
<br />
<strong>3.1 WHICH MAGENTO EDITION IS RIGHT FOR YOU?</strong><br />
You can choose between “Magento Community” and “Magento Enterprise” to develop your solution. To decide which edition is right for you, simply <a href="http://magento.com/products/overview" target="_blank">click here</a> to view descriptions of the Magento Community, Enterprise and Go editions.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.2 WHERE TO STORE CREDIT CARD DATA AND HOW DO YOU TRANSMIT IT?</strong><br />
A few other important factors to consider are where you want to store credit card data and how do you transmit it.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.2.1 OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR STORAGE</strong><br />
You can store credit card data in a Rackspace data center or use a third-party payment gateway to store credit card information using APIs. The third-party payment gateway is most common since it offloads much of your PCI burden to that provider. That being said, should you require credit card info and other sensitive data to be housed within your environment, we can architect solutions to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/pci/">help you meet PCI compliance</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.2.2 HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH OPTION IS RIGHT FOR YOU?</strong><br />
One way to determine which option is right for your business is to compare the cost of using a third-party payment gateway with the cost of storing credit card information in a data center. If you process a smaller number of credit card transactions, you might find that using a third-party payment gateway is more economical and the best option, provided it fits within your company policies. If credit card transaction volume is very high, you may find it more cost-efficient to store credit card information in a Rackspace data center and undergo PCI compliance audits. Your company policies and credit card transaction volume, along with other factors not discussed here, can help determine where to store credit card data.<br />
<br />
When you choose the option of transmitting credit card information from server side using APIs, your server infrastructure becomes part of PCI compliance. On the other hand, using APIs from client browsers, excludes your server infrastructure from the scope of PCI compliance.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.3 MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CONCURRENT USERS</strong><br />
This is the number of customers that can log into your online store simultaneously and place orders without encountering issues related to resource allocation. This is an important consideration when choosing the reference architecture for your company. We recommend designing your system for 1.5 times the peak load that you anticipate in your day-to-day transactions.<br />
<br />
In addition to the factors discussed above, the following business parameters will also influence your reference architecture design choices:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Size of catalog</li>
	<li>Average browsing time per user, (i.e. 5 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes)</li>
	<li>Average and peak visitors per day</li>
	<li>Average orders per day</li>
	<li>Peak orders per hour and per day</li>
	<li>Peak orders per hour and per day during the holiday season</li>
	<li>Number of concurrent users on admin panel</li>
	<li>Amount of SKUs/product records in catalog</li>
	<li>Amount of categories</li>
	<li>Administrative users: Over six admin users will require separation of this function to its own environment</li>
	<li>Payment Bridge: This offering from Magento can help with PCI/DSS and requires additional infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>As a rule of thumb, please remember that number of concurrent users and transactions help to size web servers. The number of SKUs for sale on the website helps to size the database server.</p>

<h3>4. Overview of Reference Architectures</h3>

<p>Based on our expertise of serving thousands of Magento customers in the past, we have developed following four <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/reference_architectures/">reference artitectures</a> as starting points:<br />
<br />
<strong>4.1 MAGENTO COMMUNITY EDITION - BASIC REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE</strong><br />
This configuration is ideal for the retailer that is looking to get started on a smaller budget, deploying Magento Community edition or an entry level Magento Enterprise Edition. Cost of entry to this solution is very low with a tremendous upside for rapid growth.<br />
<br />
This is a pure cloud configuration in which web server and database both reside in the cloud. In this architecture, we propose cloud network segmentation between web and database servers for security reasons. In this topology, you can add web and database servers for scalability. It is recommended to store customer credit card information outside the Rackspace network using third-party payment gateways when deploying to the public cloud.<br />

</ul>

<p><strong>4.2 MAGENTO ENTERPRISE EDITION - INTERMEDIATE REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE</strong><br />
This is an ideal solution for emerging Enterprise Edition retailers. It combines low cost of entry with more resources allocated to the individual servers and can be scaled to meet growing demands.<br />
<br />
This configuration is built using dedicated servers for both web and database servers. Single web and database server are segmented behind physical firewall. In this topology, customer credit card information is stored using the third-party payment gateway.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="379" src="https://8026b2e3760e2433679c-fffceaebb8c6ee053c935e8915a3fbe7.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/magento-6.png" width="499" /></p>
