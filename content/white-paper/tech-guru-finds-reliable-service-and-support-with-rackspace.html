Tech Guru focuses on a holistic, proactive approach to business IT, not just fixing things when they&rsquo;re broken. Part of their service revolves around recommending and maintaining email service for customers. They realize that managing email servers internally is more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth, so they made the decision long ago to outsource email to a hosting company.</p><p>Unfortunately, their experience with that hosting company wasn&rsquo;t positive. Daniel reports that the support and service were fine until the hosting company was bought out. When service was outsourced overseas, &ldquo;The quality of support declined tremendously,&rdquo; says Daniel. He continues, &ldquo;Problems weren&rsquo;t being resolved in a reasonable amount of time. If there was an outage, we couldn&rsquo;t reach tech support for help. It was a very frustrating experience.&rdquo;</p><p>Even though they were unhappy with their service, they hadn&rsquo;t planned on changing &ndash; until a new service option found them.</p><h3>Rackspace Delivers Support and Service</h3><p>After signing a large client with ties to Rackspace, Daniel investigated Rackspace as a solution to their email discontent. Daniel says, &ldquo;We immediately liked what we saw and switched all of our email and our customers&rsquo; email to Rackspace. We love that Rackspace has American-based tech support and the sales team gets high marks.&rdquo; He reports that getting set up with Rackspace was &ldquo;a smooth and painless process.&rdquo;</p><p>Daniel signed up with our Reseller Program. Using the program, he can rebrand and sell our email services to his customers. As a reseller, he gets deep discounts on products, marketing support, and training. While they mainly use Microsoft Exchange, the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/">Exchange Hybrid</a> is becoming more popular with his customers. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t found anyone else that offers something like the hybrid option. It definitely sets Rackspace apart. Our customers save a lot of money with it,&rdquo; says Daniel.</p><p>He is happy with the level of service he&rsquo;s received from our Fanatical Support team. &ldquo;Your reps offer the perfect level of support. They alert me of new products and beneficial offerings for me or my clients without being pushy.&rdquo; The integrated<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/apps/control_panel/"> control panel</a> management portal gives him instant access to create or edit mailboxes and view stats and activity, which, according to Daniel, &ldquo;Makes things so much easier.&rdquo;</p><h3>On-Demand Support and Reliability Makes Email Easier</h3><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to do business with a company who shares our philosophy on customer service. You have the perfect model for support,&rdquo; says Daniel. Unlike with his previous provider, Daniel can contact Rackspace&rsquo;s Fanatical Support for the answers he needs any time. &ldquo;I love that there&rsquo;s no automated machine when I call, but a real human. I can get to exactly who I need without having to go through a bunch of channels to get there,&rdquo; he says. Daniel isn&rsquo;t the only one at Tech Guru singing our praises. Another employee, Micah Thor, also states, &ldquo;Rackspace&rsquo;s customer service is stellar. We get answers right away. It&rsquo;s really phenomenal.&rdquo; With each interaction with support, Daniel reports, &ldquo;The reps make me feel like an important customer that they really want to take care of. They don&rsquo;t rush me off the phone to get to the next call.&rdquo;</p><p>As a reseller, &ldquo;I am a big fan of how much Rackspace helps me position products to help my customers,&rdquo; he states. For Daniel, Microsoft Exchange hosting with Rackspace is more than just having an operational server, &ldquo;Anyone can sell Exchange, but not the service you offer. Your service differentiates you from everyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Daniel is adamant about not selling a product he doesn&rsquo;t believe in, &ldquo;We use what we sell. We&rsquo;re proud to use Rackspace&rsquo;s email hosting services. And, we&rsquo;re proud to sell it to our customers.&rdquo;</p>
