The firm&rsquo;s five web developers serve hundreds of clients&mdash; primarily real estate agencies, law firms, medical practices, and manufacturing companies.<br /><br />After one of their dedicated servers was hacked, Southern Web Group decided to look for a new web host&mdash;one that could offer them reliability, scalability, and a solid platform for their hundreds of WordPress sites. <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/sites/">Rackspace Cloud Sites</a> fit the bill, freeing up the developers to focus on their clients, not their servers.<br /><br /><strong>CHOOSING RACKSPACE</strong><br /><br />When they launched in 2004, Southern Web Group leased dedicated servers to host their clients&rsquo; sites. None of the firm&rsquo;s five developers are system administrators, and they found managing servers to be a time-consuming pain.<br /><br />&ldquo;We had 10 dedicated and unmanaged web servers,&rdquo; says Southern Web Group president Drew Barton. &ldquo;We were responsible for maintenance, operating system updates, email deliverability, backups, and security concerns. It was a 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, 365-days-a- year commitment.&rdquo;<br /><br />The more Southern Web Group grew as a business, the more inconvenient this arrangement became. &ldquo;For years,&rdquo; Barton says, &ldquo;I literally had a phone attached to my hip, waiting for a server alert. I went three years without taking a vacation. I was a prisoner of my business.&rdquo;<br /><br />When one of the firm&rsquo;s servers was hacked, Barton decided it was finally time to switch hosts and outsource system administration. &ldquo;The bigger your business becomes,&rdquo; Barton says, &ldquo;the more you have to fire yourself from different things that you have to leave to the experts. I know how to build great-looking websites and get them to show up in search results, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have to know how to thwart a denial of service attack. I should leave that up to the folks who know how to do it best.&rdquo;<br /><br />In addition to the reliability of a fully managed host, Barton was looking for a solution that offered scalability and a strong platform for the company&rsquo;s many WordPress sites. After considering and dismissing several hosting options, Barton migrated all of his clients&rsquo; sites to Rackspace Cloud Sites and hasn&rsquo;t looked back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy to have that page turned,&rdquo; he says.<br /><br /><strong>WORDPRESS IN THE CLOUD</strong></p><p><br />Besides relieving Southern Web Group of their sys admin duties, Rackspace Cloud Sites provides a superior platform for the firm&rsquo;s 300 WordPress sites.<br /><br />&ldquo;There are big advantages to being on the cloud with WordPress,&rdquo; Barton says. &ldquo;One of the advantages is that we can do one-button upgrades to the latest version of WordPress. We can upgrade and add plugins without using FTP. In the case of a dedicated server, you&rsquo;d have to deal with SSH or root access. You don&rsquo;t have to have to deal with that on Cloud Sites.&rdquo;<br /><br />Using Rackspace Cloud Sites also improves efficiency and reduces risk, says Barton. &ldquo;We save a lot of time and manpower, and we also reduce the risk of errors that comes with doing WordPress upgrades.&rdquo;<br /><br />Barton says that Rackspace Cloud Sites also helps his sites stay secure. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a Linux shop, and now with Cloud Sites we don&rsquo;t have to deal with Linux updates and security patches. This keeps our sites more secure from malware and hackers.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The performance is great, too,&rdquo; says Barton. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t miss dedicated servers at all.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>LOOKING FORWARD TO TRAFFIC SPIKES</strong></p><p><br />As a web design firm that also handles marketing and social media for many clients, Southern Web Group wanted to make sure that driving traffic to their clients&rsquo; sites wouldn&rsquo;t cause server problems. Dedicated servers presented the possibility that sudden traffic spikes could cause crashes. With the <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>, scalability is built in.<br /><br />&ldquo;Being in Atlanta, we have a number of clients that appear on CNN and Headline News,&rdquo; Barton says. &ldquo;I called Rackspace and said, &lsquo;What happens when a client goes on national news and their web address goes across the screen? Will that crash the server?&rsquo; The sales Racker said, &lsquo;We welcome our clients to get those events, because our system is built to withstand those events.&rsquo; He was right&mdash;the Sites are able to handle a surge of traffic like that. With dedicated, you&rsquo;re concerned about the maximum number of user sessions. That fear goes away with Cloud Sites.&rdquo;<br /><br />Rackspace Cloud&rsquo;s scalability also means that the firm never has to worry about the size of their clients&rsquo; available disk space. &ldquo;If they want 20GB of space, they can have 20GB space,&rdquo; says Barton. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to limit them.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT THANKS TO FANATICAL SUPPORT&reg; SERVICE</strong></p><p><br />Once on 24-hour call, Barton can now rest easy, knowing Rackspace has his back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really nice that someone is managing my servers while I&rsquo;m asleep,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you want to see how good a possible business partner is in terms of support, I always recommend giving customer support a call at 3 a.m. If someone answers, that&rsquo;s a company you can probably rely on. We did that before we moved over to Rackspace. Knowing that someone is always there, always on&mdash;that&rsquo;s a feeling of comfort.&rdquo;<br /><br />This<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/support/"> all-hours support</a> was what differentiated Rackspace from its competitors for Barton, who says, &ldquo;The reason we didn&rsquo;t go with Amazon is they didn&rsquo;t have the customer service component that we needed. Our business offers an extremely high level of handholding. If you don&rsquo;t have that from your service provider, you can&rsquo;t give it to your client.&rdquo;<br /><br />&#x2028Would Barton recommend Rackspace Cloud to others? &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We save time, money, and headaches on the cloud. I&rsquo;ve watched our hosting bill decrease, and our uptime increase.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
