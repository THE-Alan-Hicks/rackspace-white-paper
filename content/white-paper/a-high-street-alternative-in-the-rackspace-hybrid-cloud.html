Each small business seller has been carefully chosen by notonthehighstreet.com for its innovative, well-made products to inspire shoppers looking for style, originality and quality, but who never seem to find it on the high street.</p><p>From garden to gourmet, lingerie to linen, bracelets to handbags, cushions to children’s clothes, scarves to stationery, notonthehighstreet.com has a fantastic range of beautifully made, original products. Thousands of items are available to buy from a choice of departments: home &amp; garden, women, men, baby &amp; child, gifts and wedding.</p><p>Beyond delivering a vast range of products to customers across the country, notonthehighstreet.com also champions small businesses by making sure that their site showcases their products in the best possible way. To help achieve this, notonthehighstreet.com host their business with Rackspace.</p><h3>Evolving Solution For Evolving Needs</h3><p>Notonthehighstreet.com moved to Rackspace several years ago. They selected Rackspace based on its reputation for excellence and support, and the relationship has continued to develop as the company has grown and evolved.</p><p>Steve Morgan, head of development at notonthehighstreet.com, says, “Our founders are true visionaries that never rest in their desire to bring beautiful products to market. This level of innovation means that our IT infrastructure has to be flexible. As new projects come online we need to be able to take them live quickly—for example, when our founders published their book, <em>Build a Business from Your Kitchen Table</em>, we needed to build and launch a new website on a new domain very quickly.”</p><p>“Rackspace have become essentially an extension of our in-house team,” he continues. “Their managed hosting solution means that we do not have the expense and waiting times that go with purchasing new hardware and also enables us to automate as many processes as possible, leaving us free to focus on bigger opportunitiesand projects. They also make proactive recommendations that ensure that we have the best architecture for our needs at every step of the way.”</p><h3>A Flexible, Scalable Solution for an Event-Driven Business</h3><p>Notonthehighstreet.com do around half of their annual sales in the last few months of the year and serve 40 to 50 million page views per month in the run up to Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Mothering Sunday. This means that reliability, uptime, and scalability are paramount. To complement their managed dedicated server infrastructure, notonthehighstreet.com have started to expand into the cloud by implementing a unique hybrid solution using <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/hosting_solutions/hybrid_hosting/rackconnect/">RackConnect<sup>®</sup></a>.</p><p>“Our dedicated servers provide us with the capacity we need combined with the high level of control and security required for us to transact payments and meet our PCI compliance obligations,” says Morgan. “But, as we continue to grow, we need to harness the scalability and flexibility of the cloud in order to meet both the predictable and unpredictable peaks and troughs we will inevitably experience. RackConnect bridges our dedicated and public cloud servers and we now have a best-of-both-worlds solution that will ensure that we can continue to deliver the best possible marketplace experience for both buyers and sellers.”</p><p>Notonthehighstreet.com can now scale up and down as traffic demands and deliver their content over the Akamai Content Delivery Network, so no matter where their customers are, what device they are using, or how busy the site is, they will get the experience they have come to expect from notonthehighstreet.com. Likewise, sellers get to showcase their products and process orders as fast as possible.</p><h3>Invaluable Support</h3><p>Morgan says. “A very strong relationship has developed between our two businesses and we take joint ownership of the performance of our infrastructure. They are on hand 24/7/365 days a year, and we appreciate the high levels of experience and expertise they offer. What’s more, their 100% uptime guarantee is not just a sales gimmick; it is something they are committed to delivering.”</p>
